<h1>Download</h1>
<HR><P>

Lime is <a href="http://www.opensource.org" target="_blank">open source</a>,
under the <a href="license.html">GNU Lesser General Public License</a>, and no
registration or whatsoever is needed in order to use it.&nbsp;<br>

However, we are interested in knowing who is using it around the
world, and for which kinds of projects or purposes. We would greatly
appreciate if you can take a minute to fill out the &quot;<a
href="http://sourceforge.net/survey/survey.php?group_id=12676&survey_id=11544"
target = "Top">new
users survey</a>&quot; on SourceForge before downloading.<br>

<br>
 There are essentially two ways to get a working version of Lime on your
system:

<ol>
<li> The simpler is to go to the <a
  href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lime">project summary page</a>
  and download the desired package.<br> There are two sets of files
  which can be downloaded:
  <ul>
    <li>  <code>Lime prerelease</code> contains the full distribution,
      i.e., all the required jar files, all of the examples, and the
      Lime documentation.</li> 

    <li> <code>Lime prerelease (jars only)</code> contains only the
      required jar files (containing Lime, <a href="http://lights.sourceforge.net">LighTS</a>, and <a
      href="http://mucode.sourceforge.net">µCode</a>).</li>
  </ul>

The motivation for providing two different packages is to limit the
size of your download each time we release a new jar file containing
just some bug fix.  Rather than downloading all of the documentation and
examples each time, you will only need to update the jar files.&nbsp;<br>
<u>Make sure to read the release notes (the notebook icon on the right
of the release).</u>

<li>Alternatively, you can get a snapshot of the CVS repository and
    download the current version of the source code tree.  This is the
    <i><u> most dangerous way</u></i> to get Lime because the source
    tree in the repository is not necessarily stable.  If you do this,
    you will still need to get the jar files for <a href="http://lights.sourceforge.net"> LighTS</a> and <a
    href="http://mucode.sourceforge.net">µCode</a>, and compile Lime
    yourself.
