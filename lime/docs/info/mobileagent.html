<h1>Using Lime with Your Favorite Mobile Agent System</h1>

<HR><p>Lime is designed in a way that should enable interoperability with virtually
any Java-based mobile agent system. This goal is achieved through an
adaptation layer, that nevertheless requires a little bit of programming in
order to integrate a mobile agent system.</p>

<P>The current distribution of Lime provides a built-in adapter towards the <a
href="http://mucode.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">&micro;Code</a> system,
contained in the package <code>lime.mobileagent.mucode</code>. This page uses
the code of this adapter to illustrate how a new adapter towards a different
agent platform can be built.

<!--  <p>The <code>MobileAgent</code> interface requires the implementation of a -->
<!--  single method returning the <code>lime.LimeAgentMgr</code> object associated -->
<!--  with the agent.  <code>LimeAgentMgr</code> contains a number of data -->
<!--  structures that allow the Lime run-time support of the status of the tuple -->
<!--  spaces owned by the agent upon migration.</p> -->


<p>The following steps are necessary in order to create a class
representing a Lime-aware mobile agent:</p>

<ol>
  <li>create a new subclass of the mobile agent class provided by your favorite
    system; this new class must implement the interface <code>lime.ILimeAgent</code>;</li>

  <li>in such class, define a new private field containing an object of type <code>lime.LimeAgentMgr</code>, and
      provide proper initialization;</li>

  <li>implement the <code>getMgr()</code>  method defined in <code>ILimeAgent</code>,
    which just returns the <code>LimeAgentMgr </code>object created at the previous step;</li>

  <li>redefine the migration primitive so that the <code>disengage()</code>
      method is called on the <code>LimeAgentMgr</code> object right before migration;</li>

  <li>redefine the code that starts up the agent so that the
      <code>engage()</code> method is called on the <code>LimeAgentMgr</code>
      object right before the agent starts executing.</li>

</ol>

<p>Additional modifications depending on idiosyncrasies of the the target mobile
agent system may be required.<br>
In most cases, describing the above should actually be more complicated than doing
it. As an example, here is the implementation of
<code>lime.mobileagent.mucode.MobileAgent</code>, a &quot;Lime-aware&quot; mobile agent
based on <a href="http://mucode.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">µCode</a>.
Pay attention to the inlined comments in the source code.&nbsp;</p>

  public final void migrate(String destination) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
    mgr.disengage();
    super.go(destination);
  }

  // Same as before, since mucode.MobileAgent has two different migration methods. 
  public final void migrate(String destination, String[] classes, 
                            String dynLink, boolean synch) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
    mgr.disengage();
    super.go(destination, classes, dynLink, synch);
  }

  // Similarly to migration, the run() method is wrapped in another method that first calls engage(). 
  public final void run() { 
    mgr.engage();
    doRun(); 
  }

  /** Must be redefined by the programmer with the behavior of the agent. */
  public abstract void doRun();

As you may have guessed, the key part is the <code>LimeAgentMgr</code>, which
contains all Lime needs to properly manage the agent (e.g., a concept of
identifier) and gives to the agent all it needs to interact with Lime
(essentially the <code>engage()</code>
 and <code>disengage()</code>
 methods). The code modifications are required just to allow your agent to
contain a <code>LimeAgentMgr</code> object, and to invoke the methods of
this object at the appropriate times.
<p>This technique worked well for &micro;Code, but we did not try it out with  other mobile agent
systems, and at the moment this is not a priority on our research agenda. If you
tried to integrate your favorite mobile agent system with Lime, we would be
interested to know whether and how your efforts led to success or failure. If
you were successful, you may also want to consider submitting your adapter code
as a contribution (that will be properly acknowledged) to the Lime community. </p>
