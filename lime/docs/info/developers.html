<h1>How to Contribute, or<br>
Lime Development on SourceForge</h1>

<hr>
<p>Lime is a project being carried out by a team of developers that are
geographically distributed. For this reason, we have to be careful in how the
project is managed not only across multiple developers, but also multiple
sites. While these notes will be used mostly by students at our universities, we
expect and hope they can provide insights to other people interested in joining
the Lime team.</p>

<p>So, if you want (or have :-)) to become a Lime developer, you must read
these notes first.  It is not our goal to tell you how to
behave. Nevertheless, the fact that development is distributed makes
communication more difficult and misunderstandings more likely. For this
reason, some minimal amount of guidelines and rules are needed. So, by reading
this document you should learn what people are expecting from you (and what
you can expect from others).</p>

<p>This document should also tell you what tools you should use to keep in
touch with the rest of the group. We are currently basing our
distributed development heavily on the <a href="http://sourceforge.net"
target="Resource Window"> SourceForge</a> site. If you don't know what it is,
check out the link. It's worth it. If you want to contribute to the project,
you should register and get an account at SourceForge (it's free).</p>

<p>In the rest of the document we describe some basic activities that you, as a
developer, will be likely to perform, and tell you what services based at
SourceForge you should use in order to make other people aware of your
contribution (or ask for other people's support).</p>

<p>Note that this document is by no means a replacement for reading the actual
SourceForge documentation !!! Here, we just tell you <b>what</b> service
to use: the SourceForge site has information about the details of <b>how</b>
to use such services. Feel free, however, to contact us if you feel that
there's some information missing in both places.<p>In the following, we assume
you have a SourceForge account. Also, remember that all the services that are
mentioned in the following are available through the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lime" target="Resource Window">project
summary page</a>.</p>




<hr><h2>Developing and Running Applications on top of Lime</h2>

<p>This is the minimal level of involvement you might have with Lime. You just
want to get the system, give it a try, maybe implement some application on top
of it. You are probably likely to need some help in doing that, and maybe you
will meet some bug lurking in the code.
If this is the case, we highly appreciate your feedback. If you ask us
questions, and report bugs, you are helping us improve our system (and simplify
the life of your peers).</p>

<br><h3>Downloading Lime</h3>

<p> There are essentially two ways to get a working version of Lime on your
system:
<ol>
<li> The simpler is to go to the <a
  href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lime" target="Resource Window">project
  summary page</a> and download the desired package.<br> There are two sets of
  files which can be downloaded:
  <ul>
    <li>  <code>Lime
prerelease</code> contains the full distribution, i.e., all the required jar
      files, all of the examples, and the Lime documentation.</li>
    <li>  <code>
    Lime prerelease (jars only)</code> contains only the required jar files
      (containing Lime, <a href="http://lights.sourceforge.net"
      target="Resource Window">LighTS</a>, and <a
      href="http://mucode.sourceforge.net" target="Resource
      Window">µCode</a>).</li> 
  </ul>

  The motivation for providing two different packages is that is to limit the
  size of your download each time we release a new jar file containing just
  some bug fix.  Rather than download all of the documentation and examples
  each time, you will only need to update the jar files.<br>

  <u>Make sure to read the release notes (the little notepad icon on the right
  of the release).</u>

<li>Alternatively, you can get a snapshot of the CVS repository and download
    the current version of the source code tree.  This is the <i><u> most
    dangerous way</u></i> to get Lime because the source tree in the
    repository is not necessarily stable.  If you do this, you will still need
    to get the jar files for <a href="http://lights.sourceforge.net"
    target="Resource Window">LighTS</a>, and <a
    href="http://mucode.sourceforge.net" target="Resource Window">µCode</a>,
    and compile Lime yourself.</p>

</ol>

<br><h3>Technical support</h3>

<p>After getting Lime, it is possible that you will encounter some problem in
setting up the environment, running the examples, and stuff like that. If this
is the case, please first look at the Lime documentation which comes with the
distribution.</p>

<p>If this still does not work, and you feel it that is not a bug, but rather
something we can answer for you, the place to go is the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/support/?group_id=12676" target="Resource
Window">tech support</a> page at SourceForge. The tech support feature allows
users to submit their problems to the Lime developers. Requests are forwarded
to project managers, who may answer themselves, or assign them to some
developer. Requests are logged, and can be browsed. Since it is very likely
that someone else already experience your problem, please check that this is
not the case before submitting a tech support request. Sometimes it can be
useful to browse also the list of known bugs (see below). Otherwise, please
submit a new request and be as detailed as possible about the environment you
are working in, and the specific issue which is giving you difficulty.</p>

<p>Using tech support is much more preferable than e-mailing directly one of
us. E-mails are not logged, so they can't be browsed by other
people. Furthermore, your request gets automatically forwarded to a whole
bunch of people in charge of this chore, some of them you might even not
know. So, by asking for tech support you increase your chances to receive a
precise and timely answer to your problem.</p>


<br><h3>Reporting a Bug</h3>

<p>Sometimes the problem you encounter may look like a bug rather than a
problem with the documentation or a generic request for help.  If this is the
case, please use the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=12676"
target="Resource Window">bug reporting service</a> offered by SourceForge.
First check the documentation to make sure you are using Lime as it is
expected to be used.  Then check to see if anyone else has submitted the same
bug (or possibly a tech support request) that may affect your problem.  If
not, please submit the bug and give as much detail as possible so that the
person reading this bug will be able to recreate the situation.  Please
specify the command line options you are using, as well as provide any source
code which may be useful to reproduce the bug.</p>

<p>While reporting a bug, pay attention to the fact that bugs are gathered
in categories. The available categories are:
<ul>
  <li>&quot;console&quot;: be used for all bugs related to the graphical user
    interface;</li>
  <li>&quot;mobile agent&quot;: for issues related either with the µCode mobile agent
utilities or with the integration of another mobile agent toolkit;</li>
  <li>&quot;launcher&quot;: for problems related with loading agents either from the
command line or from within your application.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your bug is related to one of these, please indicate so.  If not, leave
the field at the default: &quot;none&quot;.</p>

<br><h3>Monitoring the Lime Project </h3>

<p> Lime is very much work in progress.  If you are interested in being
notified when a new release of a Lime package is issued, you can just
<u>monitor the package</u>. It's trivial: you just have to click the little
icon that says &quot;Monitor&quot; at the right of the package you want to
keep track of. The monitor feature is available for other stuff at
SourceForge, most notably the forums. Use it. You will be notified by e-mail
whenever there are changes.</p>

<p>If, instead, you want to be notified by the project administrators when
something relevant is available or is changed, please <a
href="mailto:lime-admin@lists.sourceforge.net"> send a request to the project
administrators </a> to be added to the <a
href="mailto:lime-users@lists.sourceforge.net">lime-users@lists.sourceforge.net</a>
mailing list (right now the mailing list is private so you can't subscribe by
yourself. This is going to change when we publicly release Lime. You are
encouraged to do so. Traffic on this list should be minimal, but it will keep
you up to date when there are major occurrences with Lime.</p>

<p>On the other hand, you can also monitor proactively the status of Lime by
going to the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lime" target="Resource
Window">project summary page</a> for Lime at SourceForge.  From there, you can
monitor forums to hear what others have said about Lime, read news about Lime,
watch for when new releases of the source and/or jar files, subscribe the the
mailing lists, see plans for future development, and so on.<b> Please check
the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lime" target="Resource
Window">project summary page</a> often to keep up to date.</b></p>

<hr><h2>Contributing as a User (Feature Requests and New Ideas)</h2>

<p>While working with Lime, or learning it, you might have some ideas about
new features, new demos, or new research tasks that could be explored with
Lime. We welcome contributions from anyone. Nevertheless, again, rather than
simply contacting us through e-mail we encourage you to use the services at
SourceForge to share information with other users, and have answers to your
questions as quickly as possible.</p>


<br><h3>Requesting a New Feature</h3>

<p>While working with Lime, you might find yourself struggling because of a
feature that is clearly missing in the current implementation.  SourceForge
does not provide any service specific to new feature request. For this, we are
using the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=12676"
target="Resource Window">bug reporting service</a> offered by SourceForge,
where we added a new bug group called &quot;feature request&quot;. <u>Remember
to select this bug group (together with any bug category it may fit) when you
submit your feature request</u>.  Feature requests will be evaluated by the
Lime team and possibly become new tasks available for developers.</p>

<p>Clearly, the kind of feature request we are talking about here are stuff like
&quot;I'd like to have an option to engage a server from the command line&quot;,
or &quot;I'd like to be able to choose the background of the console&quot;.
Requests like &quot;I would like for Lime to scale over a zillion nodes&quot; or
&quot;I would like Lime to be integrated with a relational DBMS&quot; are
&quot;major&quot; feature requests that require some additional discussion in
order to understand the detail of what you are proposing. These discussions are
likely to happen in forums, as outlined below.</p>

<br><h3>Discussing about Lime</h3>

<p>If you have any questions about the general ideas behind Lime, or about its
applicability to certain scenarios, we welcome you to join the discussion in
the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=12676" target="Resource
Window">Open Discussion</a> forum hosted on SourceForge. We expect answers to
posts here to be answered by the larger community of Lime users and developers
(as opposed to answers coming directly from the project managers). We hope
that this will be a free exchange of ideas, both related to the implementation
as well as the research issues behind this system.</p>

<p>As already mentioned, an important feature provided by SourceForge is the
ability to monitor a forum. If you choose to monitor the Open Discussion
forum, you will receive email notification whenever a message is posted.



<hr><h2>Contributing as a Developer (Designs and Source Code)</h2>

<p>This is the maximum level of involvement with the Lime project: you help us
building pieces of it, and evolving it. Granted, it's fun. :-) There are
plenty of opportunities to get involved in the development of Lime.  To find
some details on these, take a look at the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/pm/?group_id=12676" target="Resource
Window">subprojects and tasks</a> listed on project site. Tasks are added to
the list according to suggestions coming from users and developers. These
tasks vary a lot in complexity: some of time are just simple features missing,
others might have a complexity comparable to a bachelor or master thesis.</p>

<p><b><u> Please note that, in order to use the services described below, you
must be a Lime developer at SourceForge.  If you are not, first get a
SourceForge account, then <a href="mailto:lime-admin@lists.sourceforge.net">
contact the project administrators</a> and request to be added.</u></b></p>

<br><h3>Taking on Tasks and Discussing Plans</h3>

<p> If you are interested in taking on a development task, first make sure
that everyone involved in the development effort knows your interest and
intention.  This is appropriately done with a request to the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=12676" target="Resource
Window">developers forum</a>, either by identifying specifically one of the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/pm/?group_id=12676" target="Resource
Window">subprojects or Tasks</a> already defined, or by describing your new,
proposed task. Once agreement is reached about the requirements, goals, the
project administrators should then assign this task to you by updating the
Task list.</p>

<p> Before coding, discuss your plans and design with other people by posting
detailed messages to the Developers forum. <u>By all means, plan everything
before you do it, and share information</u>.  Everyone working on this project
has some level of expertise and previous coding experiences which can help us
all from falling on our faces more than necessary.  When you come across a
problem don't bang your head against the wall for too long.  Ask for help.
Perhaps someone has faced a similar problem in the past and can offer an
immediate solution.</p>

<br><h3>Retrieving and Contributing Code: CVS</h3>

<p>The Lime source tree, together with all the documentation, examples, and
other material is stored on a CVS repository at SourceForge. CVS is a
configuration and version management system that is basically a standard for
open source development (and is itself available as open source). <b><u>You
eventually have to learn the basics of CVS if you want to become a Lime
developer.</u></b></p>

<p>You can browse the content of the CVS repository by using the Web interface
provided by SourceForge. This service even allows you to compare the
difference between versions stored in the repository.</p>

<p>To do the real thing, however, you need to have CVS installed on your
machine. Version of CVS exists for many platforms and can be downloaded at <a
href="http://www.cvshome.org" target="Resource Window">www.cvshome.org</a>.
At that site you find a wealth of documentation about CVS, and other pointers
are available at SourceForge. Don't be frightened, however: you don't need to
become a CVS guru, just learn the basic commands to check-in and check-out
source code. The documentation available at these sites has some pretty good
&quot;primers&quot;. Just as an example, the command to retrieve the whole
Lime CVS tree on your machine is:<br>

<center><code>cvs -d:ext:loginname@cvs.lime.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/lime co lime </code></center>

<p>Be aware that some configuration steps have to be taken on your machine
before being able to launch successfully this command. This holds especially if
you are using Windows; under Unix life is much easier. In particular, make sure
you are using SSH. Anyway, the SourceForge site has detailed instructions about
how to install and configure CVS and SSH on Windows and other
platforms.</p>

<p><b><u><font color="#FF0000">ATTENTION:</font></u> </b><u>once you become a
developer, you have full write access on the CVS repository</u>. (When
SourceForge will implement a way to constrain developers' access rights on
CVS, things may change.) So, needless to say, <u> you should become familiar
with the CVS model before reaching this point of contribution to Lime</u>. The
best way to do this is to read parts of the <a href="
http://www.gnu.org/manual/cvs-1.9/html_mono/cvs.html" target="Resource
Window">CVS manual</a>.  An excellent place to start is the section of this
manual: <a href="http://www.gnu.org/manual/cvs-1.9/html_mono/cvs.html#SEC10"
target="Resource Window">A Sample Session</a>. In other words, <font
color="#FF0000"><b><u>do not insert/modify files in the repository unless you
absolutely know what are you doing</u></b></font>. The first times please
check with the administrators what you are going to do. In particular, if you
are working on a subproject or task, you are likely to need the creation of
entire subdirectories hosting your code. <u><b><font color="#FF0000"> Be aware
that your modifications may affect the work of other people</font></b></u>
(or, in other words, that you can screw up the work of other people, and
trigger many unpleasant reactions).</p>


<br><h3>Contacting Developers Quickly</h3>

<p> In order to reach the other developers and users of Lime, we have two
mailing lists available: <a
href="mailto:lime-dev@lists.sourceforge.net">lime-dev@lists.sourceforge.net</a>,
and <a
href="mailto:lime-dev@lists.sourceforge.net">lime-users@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.
We expect that lime-users will only be used by the project administrators to
announce new releases of the system, and/or communicate news about Lime.
Instead, lime-dev should be used by the Lime developers to keep in touch, and
make other people aware of relevant modifications.</p>

<p> For example, if you want immediate feedback on a change you just submitted
to the repository, post a message to lime-dev.  Overall the traffic on these
mailing lists should be minimal as most of the development operations will be
handled through the other SourceForge utilities, and most of discussions will
go through the forums. Both of these mailing lists are currently private. To
be added, <a href="mailto:lime-admin@lists.sourceforge.net"> send a request to
the project administrators</a>.</p>

<hr>
<h2> Unanticipated Issues</h2> 

<p>This document is by no means a complete explanation of how Lime is making
use of the SourceForge features.  If you have a specific question about the
appropriate manner to discuss something, please poke around on SourceForge and
see if you can figure it out intuitively.  If not, <a
href="mailto:lime-admin@lists.sourceforge.net"> contact the project
administrators</a>.</p>

<p>Also, this document will be likely to change in the future, in order to
accommodate changes in the project management, in the tools available on
SourceForge, and such. So, now and then check this Web page.</p>
