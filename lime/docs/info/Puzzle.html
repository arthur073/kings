<h1>Roaming Jigsaw</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>RoamingJigsaw, is a multi-player jigsaw assembly game. A group of players
cooperate on the solution of the jigsaw puzzle in a disconnected fashion. They
construct assemblies independently, share intermediate results, and acquire
pieces from each other when connected. Play begins with one player loading the
puzzle pieces to a shared tuple space. Any connected player sees the puzzle
pieces of the other connected players and can select pieces they wish to work
with. When a piece is selected, all connected players observe this as a change
in the colored border of the piece, and within the system, the piece itself is
moved to be co-located with the selecting player. When a player disconnects,
the workspace does not change, but the pieces that have been selected by the
departing player can no longer be selected and manipulated. From the
perspective of the disconnected player, pieces whose border is tagged with the
player's color can be assembled into clusters. Additionally, the player can
connect to other players to further redistribute the pieces, and to view the
progress made by the other players with respect to any clusters formed since
last connected. </p>

<p>This application is based on a pattern of interaction where the shared
workspace provides an accurate image of the global state of connected players
but only weakly consistent with the global state of the system as a whole. The
user workspace contains the last known information about each puzzle piece. It
is interesting to observe that the globally set goal of the distributed
application, i.e., the solution of the puzzle, is built incrementally through
successive updates to the local state, distributed to all other players either
immediately if connected or in a ``lazy'' fashion if connectivity is not
available at that time. </p>

<h2>Playing the Game</h2>

First, compile the RoamingJigsaw code in the
<code>examples/RoamingJigsaw</code> directory.  Start the puzzle by loading
<code>LimePuzzleAgent</code> using the standard Lime Launcher with the
following command:

<p><code>java lime.util.Launcher -load LimePuzzleAgent</code></p>

<p>You can run additional puzzle agents on a different computer using the same
command.  To run another puzzle program on the same computer, execute the
following command from a different window:</p>

<p><code>java lime.util.Launcher -quit -load LimePuzzleAgent</code></p>

<h4>What to Expect</h4>

<p>When each puzzle begins, it will ask you to enter the name of the puzzle
game. All puzzle games with the same name will be able to share pieces. Enter
a name in the box and continue. Next, the puzzle will ask you to choose a
color. This is the color that will identify this player. Choose a color and
continue. Next, the program asks if you would like to declare this host as the
leader. Respond "yes" for one host; and "no" for all others. At this point,
the initial puzzle screen will appear:</p>

<table border="0">
    <tr>
        <td><img src="images/firstpuzzle.jpg" width="329"
        height="269"></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>There will be four buttons on the screen: Engage/Disengage, Share/Unshare,
New Puzzle, and Quit. If this host is the leader, the Engage/Disengage button
will read "Disengage".  Otherwise it will read "Engage". This indicates
whether or not this host is engaged (or willing to share) with other hosts in
the network. The button is a toggle--pressing this button when it reads
"Engage" will engage the host; pressing this button when it reads "Disengage"
will disengage the host. The second button is the Share/Unshare button. If
this agent is the one who declared its host as the leader this button will
initially read "Unshare". In all other cases, this button will read "Share"
initially. This button is also a toggle; its status indicates whether or not
this agent's tuple space is public or private.  Pressing this button when it
reads "Share" will cause the tuple space to become public. Conversely,
pressing it while it reads "Unshare" will make the agent's tuple space
private. The New Puzzle button allows the agent to open an image and convert
it to a puzzle, displaying the puzzle pieces on the screen. The Quit button
exits the program. The Quit button is only enabled when the host is
disengaged.</p>

<p>After one agent has started a new puzzle, the pieces will be displayed on
that agent's screen. If the tuple space of the agent creating the puzzle is
shared, the pieces will also be displayed on the screens of agents on the same
host whose tuple spaces are also shared. If the host of the agent creating the
puzzle is engaged, the pieces will also be displayed on the screens of agents
on other hosts in the network that are also engaged (again, if the agents'
tuple spaces are shared). When the puzzle pieces are displayed, they have a
colored border around them. The color of this border indicates which agent is
responsible for the piece. </p>

<p><b>Manipulating puzzle pieces.</b> An agent can take responsibility of a
piece belonging to another agent by right clicking on the piece.  The border
color of the piece will then change to indicate the color of the new
responsible agent. You can move pieces by clicking them with the left button
of the mouse and dragging them. You can rotate pieces by double clicking them,
or, by pressing the space bar or arrow keys while selecting the piece with the
left mouse button. When you move two pieces close together in the positions in
which they will fit, they will snap together. To put together two pieces, an
agent must be responsible for both pieces.</p>

<p>A puzzle in an intermediate state is shown below.  The <i>blue</i> agent
shown.  It can be inferred that there are at least two other agents
participating, <i>red</i> and <i>yellow</i>.  The blue agent is currently
sharing its pieces, and the host that it resides on is engaged in the Lime
community:</p>

<h2>How Roaming Jigsaw Puzzle Uses Lime</h2>

<p>When a LimePuzzleAgent begins, it requests from the user the name of the
puzzle game. This name is used as the name of the agent's tuple space. When an
agent creates a puzzle by loading a new puzzle, the picture is broken into the
number of pieces specified. These pieces are then wrapped in tuples and placed
in the tuple space using multiple <strong>out</strong> operations.  When an
agent takes over responsibility of a puzzle piece from another agent, the
agent removes the tuple from the tuple space by performing an
<strong>inp</strong>. The agent then returns the puzzle piece to its own tuple
space with an <strong>out</strong>.  Now the new agent is responsible for the
puzzle piece, as designated by the change in the color of the piece. When an
agent connects two puzzle pieces, the tuples corresponding to the two pieces
being connected are removed from the tuple space (using two <strong>inp
</strong>operations) and a new piece, the combined piece, is placed in the
tuple space (using an <strong>out</strong> operation).</p>

<p>The puzzle pieces seen on an agent's screen are representations of the
tuples it has seen in the tuple space.  Every agent registers a ONCEPERTUPLE
weak reaction that reacts to the presence of a new tuple corresponding to a
new puzzle piece. When a new piece shows up, the agent reacts to the new
tuple.  In its reaction, it removes the old piece(s) from the screen and
replaces it with the new one.</p>

<p>Hosts can only react to tuples in tuple spaces that their tuple spaces are
engaged with and are shared. The sharing of the tuple spaces is accomplished
by setting the tuple space to shared. The engaging of the tuple spaces is
accomplished by engaging the host, which makes the tuple space available for
operations and reactions from hosts in the network.</p>
