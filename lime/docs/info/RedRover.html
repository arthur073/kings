<h1>Red Rover: An Interactive Video Game</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>RedRover is a spatial game in which individuals equipped with small mobile
devices form teams and interact in a physical environment augmented with
virtual elements. This forces the participants to rely to a great extent on
information provided by the mobile units and not solely on what is visible to
the naked eye. </p>

<p>The key component of RedRover is that players share their physical location
in space. Each player has a kind of <i>radar image</i> on their screen which
is constantly updated with the locations of (connected) players as they move.
</p>

<h2>Playing the Game</h2>

First compile the RedRover code in the <code>examples/RedRover</code>
directory.  Start the game with:


<p><code>java Game &lt;config_file&gt;<code></p>

<p>from the game distribution directory. Appendix A contains
information about configuration files.</p>

<p>Only one instance of Red Rover can run in each LimeServer, although
multiple instances can be run on the same host if you specify diffeerent
ports as in <code>java Game rr.gp -port 1900</code>.  Be sure that one of the
players is designated (in its configuration file) to be the leader.</p>

<h4>What to Expect</h4>

<p>When the game begins, the user interface appears on your screen similar
to the following, but only showing the icon for your player in the center of
the screen.</p>

<table border="0">
    <tr>
        <td><img src="images/rrscreen.jpg" width="628"
        height="399"></td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p>The screen above shows a game involving four players on four computers--two
on the red team, and two on the yellow team.  Assuming that one of the red
players is the leader, the other players joined this player by pressing their
engagement button (see below).  This brings us to the nine buttons on the left
side of the interface. Each of these buttons has a unique purpose during game
play as described below. The first four buttons represent the current state of
the GUI and thus only one of these four can be selected at any given time.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p
    style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 10; margin-bottom: 10"><img
    src="images/bmagdn.gif" width="25" height="26"> <b><i>Zoom</i></b>:
    After selecting this button you will be able to zoom in and
    out by clicking anywhere in the window and moving the mouse up and
    down.</p> 
    <p
    style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 10; margin-bottom: 10"><img
    src="images/b4dirdn.gif" width="25" height="26"> <b><i>Map
    Move</i></b>: After selecting this button you can
    explore other regions of the map <i>without </i>moving your
    player by clicking and dragging on the screen.</p>
    <p
    style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 10; margin-bottom: 10"><img
    src="images/bplydn.gif" width="25" height="26"> <b><i>Player
    Move</i></b>: After selecting this button you can move
    your player by clicking and dragging on the map.  Your player "walks" in
    the direction that you drag the mouse.</p>
    <p
    style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 10; margin-bottom: 10"><img
    src="images/bplyinfodn.gif" width="25" height="26"> <em><strong>Player
    Info</strong></em>: After selecting this button, clicking on
    any player's dot on the screen will bring up information
    about them. This information might include (but is not
    limited to) a picture of the player.  You will be able to get more
    information about players on your same team.</p>
</blockquote>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 15; margin-bottom: 15">The
next three buttons work like toggle switches, each controlling a
distinct aspect of the game.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p
    style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 10; margin-bottom: 10"><img
    src="images/btgtdn.gif" width="25" height="26"> <b><i>Map
    Re-center</i></b>: When this button is &quot;down&quot;
    your player is positioned in the center of the compass.
    However, performing a map move will cause this button to
    automatically change to the &quot;up&quot; position.</p>
    <p
    style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 10; margin-bottom: 10"><img
    src="images/bnthdn.gif" width="25" height="26"> <b><i>North
    Lock</i></b>: Clicking this button will toggle your
    view so that the top of the screen is either (1) pointing
    north or (2) pointing the direction your player is
    facing. When the button is &quot;down&quot; then you
    are in mode (1) and when the button is &quot;up&quot; then
    you are in mode (2).</p>
    <p
    style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 10; margin-bottom: 10"><img
    src="images/bengdn.gif" width="25" height="26">
    <b><i>Engage/Disengage</i></b>:   This is one of the most critical buttons
    when playing RedRover!!
    Clicking this button will engage/disengage you to the
    game. You are engaged when the button is
    &quot;down&quot; and disengaged when the button is
    &quot;up&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The last two buttons deal with looking for and finding objects
while playing the game. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><img
    src="images/bobjfounddn.gif" width="25" height="26"> <b><i>Found
    Object</i></b>: This button allows a player to announce
    that he has found an object. This can be used in a
    clue-finding game or in a game in the spirit of capture the
    flag.</p>
    <p
    style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 10; margin-bottom: 10"><b><i><img
    src="images/bobjlookdn.gif" width="25" height="26"> Look for
    Object</i></b>: This button allows a player to indicate
    a type of object he would like to look for (for example a
    flag of a particular color).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unless you are the <i>Lime leader</i>, the first thing that you will need
to do is <i>engage</i> so that you can communicate with the rest of the people
in the game. To do this, click on the engage/disengage button. After engaging
you will see the other players appear on your screen. You're now ready to play
the game!</p>

<p>Game play proceeds as players use the features specified above to move
about the map. One of the games you can play with Red Rover is a simple freeze
tag where one team is <i>it</i> (see the configuration file). When a player
from the <i>it</i> team tags a player on any other team, that player is
frozen. A frozen player can be unfrozen by being tagged by a member of his own
team.</p>

<h2>How Red Rover Uses Lime</h2>

<p>When an instance of Red Rover begins, two tuple spaces are created. One is
the team tuple space, and one is the game tuple space. The game tuple space is
used to communicate with all other agents playing the game. The team tuple
space is used to communicate only with agents on the same team. There is a
Lime StationaryAgent inside the Red Rover game. It is this agent that allows
the players to interact with each other. There are two ways the players
communicate with each other. One method is to register weak reactions on the
team and/or public tuple spaces as a way of listening for information from
other players.  The other method is to write tuples to the team and/or public
tuple spaces to share information with other players.</p>

<p>After the tuple spaces are set up, the agent registers one weak reaction in
the team tuple space and one weak reaction in the public tuple space. These
weak reactions will fire whenever a new tuple arrives that should be
processed. The reactions then fire an event which is processed by the
game.</p>

<p>After the agent registers the weak reactions, it will enter an infinite
loop for writing tuples. For each iteration through the loop, the Interactor
will wait to dequeue an item from its synchronized queue (the Interactor uses
a queue from the Lime API -- gp.util.Queue). Once an item is available from
the queue, it will be processed by wrapping it in a tuple and then writing the
tuple out to the appropriate tuple space. The tuples that are written out to
the tuple space contain information about the Interactor that it would like to
share either with everyone or with other agent's on his team. For example, a
player might place a location tuple in the tuple space. Then, as he moves, he
removes his old location tuple from the tuple space (via an
<strong>inp</strong> operation) and then writes his new location (via an
<strong>out </strong>operation).  Other players who would like to know the
current location of that player would register a reaction to react to new
location tuples of other players. When these reactions are fired, the players'
screens are updated with the new information.</p>
