        tuple space. </li>
    <li><a href="examples.html#InteractiveMobileAgent">Interactive
        Mobile Agent</a> A simple mobile agent which allows
        interaciton with the tuple space, and migration. </li>

<p>We plan to add fancier examples as Lime gets used for teaching
and research purposes. If you develop a nice application and
would like to see it included in the distribution as a Lime demo,
contact <a href="authors.html">us</a>! </p>

<h4>How to run the examples:</h4>

<p>All the interactive agent examples require launching a Lime
server and loading into it the agent that contains the
application's logic. Please consult the documentation about <a
href="server.html">using the Launcher</a>. </p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="InteractiveAgent">Interactive Agent</a></h2>

<p>This <a href="../../examples/InteractiveAgent.java">example </a>
demonstrates the capability of the package <code>lime.util.console</code> and,
at the same time, provides a useful tool for debugging Lime
applications. The interactive agent simply displays a graphical console which
can be used to perform operations on a Lime tuple space. </p>

<h4>How to run the example:</h4>

<p>Start a Lime server with an <code>InteractiveAgent</code>: </p>

<pre>java lime.util.Launcher -load InteractiveAgent</pre>

<p>Additional <code>InteractiveAgent</code>s can be loaded into
the same JVM by typing </p>

<pre>java lime.util.Launcher -quit -load InteractiveAgent</pre>

<p>in a separate window on the same host. </p>

<h4>What to expect:</h4>

<p>On the shell running the Lime server the following messages
will appear: </p>

<pre>
&gt;java lime.util.Launcher -load InteractiveAgent
Lime:Factory set to lights.adapters.builtin.TupleSpaceFactory
Lime:Lime server murphy:1973 activated
Lime:Listening for agents
Lime:Agent InteractiveAgent loaded and started.
</pre>

<p>After a short delay, the window with the console will appear.
For details about how to use the console see this <a
href="console.html">description</a>. For details about how to use
the Lime console from within your agents, please consult the API
documentation of
 <a href="../api/lime/util/console/LimeConsole.html"
target="Resource Window"><code>lime.util.LimeConsole</code></a>. </p>

<h4>Worth Noting:</h4>

<p>The code for <code>InteractiveAgent</code> is really small: </p>

<pre>
public class InteractiveAgent extends StationaryAgent {
  LimeTupleSpace lts = null;
  LimeConsole c;
  
  public InteractiveAgent() throws LimeException {
    super(&quot;InteractiveAgent&quot;);
  }
  
  public void run() { 
    try { 
      lts = new LimeTupleSpace(); 
    } catch (LimeException le) { le.printStackTrace(); }
    c = new LimeConsole(getMgr().getID(), lts);
    while(true) {
      String s = c.performQueuedOp(); 
    }
  }
}
</pre>

<p>The constructor simply calls the constructor of the standard
<code>StationaryAgent</code>, naming the thread with a specified string. The
<code>run()</code> method of the agent takes care of creating a default tuple
space and processing the queue of requested operations maintained by the Lime
console. Remember that the method <code>performQueuedOp</code> blocks if the
queue is empty, which simplifies the code for the agent. </p>

<p>Please note that the Lime tuple space must be created by the same thread
that performs opertaions on it. In other words, the tuple space cannot be
created from within the <code>InteractiveAgent</code> constructor. And the
operations to be performed on the tuple space cannot be performed directly by
the <code>LimeConsole</code> but must be executed by the thread of the
<code>InteractiveAgent</code>.
</p>

<p>Please also note that the <code>go</code> method in the console will have
no effect on the <code>InteractiveAgent</code>.</p>

<h2><a name="InteractiveMobileAgent">Interactive Mobile Agent</a></h2>

<p>The primary difference between <a
href="../../examples/InteractiveMobileAgent.java">this agent</a> and the previous
one is the enabling of the <code>go</code> operation on this agent.  To start
this example, you must use the <code>Launcher</code> associated with µcode
mobile agents, as in: </p>

<pre> java lime.mobileagent.mucode.Launcher --mucode -debug off --load InteractiveMobileAgent </pre>

<p>For details on the mobile agent <code>Launcher</code> parameters, consult
the <a href="server.html">documentation</a>.
</p>

<h2><a name="InteractiveMonitorAgent">Interactive Monitor Agent</a></h2>

<p>The <a href="../../examples/InteractiveMonitorAgent.java"><code>
InteractiveMonitorAgent</code></a> displays how the
<code>LimeSystemTupleSpace</code> can be used to track the presence of other
agents, hosts, and tuple spaces. This example installs six separate reactions
on the LimeSystem tuple space, each of which writes a line to the
<code>LimeConsole</code> when a change occurs in the system
configuration. Launch it as you would a regular <code>InteractiveAgent</code>:
</p>

<pre>java lime.util.Launcher -load InteractiveMonitorAgent</pre>

<hr>

<h2><a name="SimpleLime">Simple Lime</a></h2>

<p>The primary benefit to this <a
href="../../examples/SimpleLime.java">example</a> is to demonstrate how to
construct an application that will launch Lime itself. The source code
demonstrates the use of the <code>Launcher</code> to pass parameters to Lime,
and how to load in agent directly into the <code>LimeServer</code>.  Rather
than launching this application directly using the launcher, use the
following: </p>

<pre>java SimpleLime msg</pre>

<p>or pass Lime any desired Lime parameters as in: </p>

<pre>java SimpleLime msg -mcast off</pre>

<hr>
<h2><a name="weakProbe">Weak Probe LTS Operations</a></h2>

<p>The <a
href="../../examples/WeakProbeLimeTupleSpace.java">WeakProbeLimeTupleSpace</a>
class is unlike the other examples, in that it is not a stand-alone
application which exploits Lime.  Instead, it serves as an example of how to
extend the basic LimeTupleSpace with operations which are aggregates of the
basic operations.  Specifically, the <code>WeakProbeLimeTupleSpace</code>
provides the operations <code>weakInp</code>, <code>weakRdp</code>,
<code>weakIng</code>, and <code>weakRdg</code> which probe the federated tuple
space for either a single matching tuple, or all matching tuples.

<p>The execution of these operations is not performed atomically over a
<i>snapshot</i> of the federated tuple space, but is performed individually
and incrementally over the hosts-level tuple spaces which are present in the
federation when the operation is invoked.  For example, if hosts A, B and C
are connected and have agents with transiently shared tuple spaces of the same
name; if an agent on host A issues one of these weak operations, the result
returned will be the cumulative result of probing operation performed first on
A, then on B, then on C.  If B or C disconnect before the operation is
complete, it is as if the result of the probe of that host returned
<code>null</code>.  If host D connects during the operation, D is ignored for
this operation.

<p>To use this class, an agent should create an instance of a
<code>WeakProbeLimeTupleSpace</code> instead of a <code>LimeTupleSpace</code>.
All normal operations of a <code>LimeTupleSpace</code> are available through a
<code>WeakProbeLimeTupleSpace</code>.

<h2><a name="puzzle">RoamingJigsaw</a></h2>

<p>RoamingJigsaw, is a multi-player jigsaw puzzle assembly game. A group of
players cooperate on the solution of the jigsaw puzzle in a disconnected
fashion. They construct assemblies independently, share intermediate results,
and acquire pieces from each other when connected. Play begins with one player
loading the puzzle pieces to a shared tuple space. Any connected player sees
the puzzle pieces of the other connected players and can select pieces they
wish to work with. When a piece is selected, all connected players observe
this as a change in the colored border of the piece, and within the system,
the piece itself is moved to be co-located with the selecting player. When a
player disconnects, the workspace does not change, but the pieces that have
been selected by the departing player can no longer be selected and
manipulated. From the perspective of the disconnected player, pieces whose
border is tagged with the player's color can be assembled into
clusters. Additionally, the player can connect to other players to further
redistribute the pieces, and to view the progress made by the other players
with respect to any clusters formed since last connected. </p>

<p>This application is based on a pattern of interaction where
the shared workspace provides an accurate image of the global
state of connected players but only weakly consistent with the
global state of the system as a whole. The user workspace
contains the last known information about each puzzle piece. It
is interesting to observe that the globally set goal of the
distributed application, i.e., the solution of the puzzle, is
built incrementally through successive updates to the local
state, distributed to all other players either immediately if
connected or in a ``lazy'' fashion if connectivity is not
available at that time. </p>

<h2><a name="RedRover">RedRover</a></h2>

<p>RedRover is a spatial game in which individuals equipped with small mobile
devices form teams and interact in a physical environment augmented with
virtual elements. This forces the participants to rely to a great extent on
information provided by the mobile units and not solely on what is visible to
the naked eye. </p>

<p>The key component of RedRover is that players share their physical location
in space. Each player has a kind of <i>radar image</i> on their screen which
is constantly updated with the locations of (connected) players as they
move. </p>
