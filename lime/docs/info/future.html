<h1>Future Plans</h1>
<HR><p>Lime is very much an ongoing project.  In addition to the research goals,
we have several enhancements planned.  Some are in the immediate future while
others involve more long-term commitments.  Some of these possibilities
include the following.  If you want to know more about the progress which has
been made on any of these projects, please <a
href="mailto:lime-admin@lists.sourceforge.net">contact us</a>.

<dt><b> Reacting to events</b>
<dd> The current implementation allows a user to react to the current state of
  the system.  In many cases, it may be useful to react to an operation being
  performed on the system.  For example, a user may want to watch for the
  removal of a specific tuple with the <code>in</code> operation.  One of the
  nice things about this extension is that the ability to react to an event
  can be implemented using the same model as reacting to state.  In other
  words, an event (e.g., the execution of the <code>in</code> operation) can
  be represented as a tuple in a system-maintained tuple space.  Once this is
  present, the current state-based reactions can be used to provide the
  semantics of reacting to an event.

<dt><b> Application level routing</b> <dd> Lime currently provides the ability
  to place a tuple at a specific destination.  A tuple migrates to this
  destination when connectivity is available.  In some cases, it may be useful
  to provide application-enhanced routing in order to get a tuple to its
  destination without a direct connection existing between the source and the
  destination.  For example, Agent A writes a tuple destined for Agent C.
  Agent B is connected to Agent A and has some application knowledge that it
  will be connected with Agent C at a time before agent A.  In this case, it
  would be useful for Agent B to take the tuple from Agent A, put it in Agent
  B's tuple space, and transfer it to Agent C when connectivity exists.  This
  type of routing must be enhanced by application knowledge of connectivity
  patterns and should be written entirely outside of, or on top of Lime.  We
  have begun investigating these ideas and all publications will be <a
  href="http://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/murphy/papers/index.html">available
  online</a>.

<dt><b>Security</b>
<dd> The current version of Lime assumes that every agent which knows the name
  of a tuple space can access any content in that tuple space.  While the
  knowledge of the name must be know, this alone does not provide any security
  because of the existence and accessibility of the <code>LimeSystem</code>
  tuple space and the ability to retrieve a tuple space name from that space.
  Lime also provides a private tuple space whose contents are not visible to
  any but the creating agent; however, as this does not allow any kind of
  sharing, it is limited in its usefulness.  We would like to add some notion
  of security to Lime, either by requiring authentication prior to enabling
  an agent's access to shared date, or by requiring authentication to perform
  any operation such as tuple removal from a tuple space.  This also
  encompasses the notion of read-only tuples or tuple spaces.  Accomplishing
  this goal may require research into authentication in ad hoc networks where
  there is no way to contact a trusted server, and <i>trust</i> will have to
  be built incrementally as the ad hoc network grows.  Some initial work was
  done on this as a class project at Washington University.  Details are
  available upon <a href="mailto:lime-admin@lists.sourceforge.net">request</a>.

<dt><b>Scoping</b> <dd> In the current version of Lime, all hosts and agents
  within connectivity range will share their tuple spaces of the same name.
  While this is acceptable for small, ad hoc networks, as the networks grow,
  this may no longer be acceptable.  We may want to limit the scope of sharing
  for security reasons, to limit the number of hosts, or to limit the distance
  among the connected hosts.  Some work has been done in this direction by
  Bryan Payne.  If you are interested in his results, contact the <a
  href="mailto:lime-admin@lists.sourceforge.net">Lime authors</a>.

<dt><b>Tuple Multicast and Anycast</b>
<dd> In the current model of Lime, a tuple can specify exactly one
  destination.  In some cases, it may be useful to specify that a copy of a
  tuple is to be placed with each new agent which is connected (<i>tuple
  multicast</i>). Alternately, a tuple may be moved to the first agent that
  matches a given criteria (<i>tuple anycast</i>) 

<dt><b> Replication</b>
<dd> Many times replication can be useful to decrease the access latency to
  data.  In a mobile environment, replication of data can also increase access
  in the presence of disconnection.  However, where there is replication,
  there is also the possibility of a replica becoming stale, and other issues
  of disconnected operation including  the need to   reconcile data
  opportunistically when connectivity is available.   

<dt><b>LimeLight</b>
<dd> What needs to be done to tailor Lime to only logical mobility?  It
  involves stripping out many of the communication mechanisms, and need to
  handle remote operations.  By extracting the essential Lime characteristics,
  we can have a smaller footprint that can be used for logical mobility on
  small physically mobile device.  An alternate use is to support coordination
  among  logically mobile agents co-located on fixed hosts.

<dt><b>Unannounced disconnection</b> 
<dd> One of the characteristics of many mobile environments where connectivity
  is through wireless mediums is the possibility of losing the connection
  between a pair of nodes rather suddenly.  This can occur either by simply
  moving out of range of the devices or by moving into a, so called, dead zone
  (e.g., a tunnel) where connectivity is not possible.  Some work has been
  done to <a
  href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/mobilab/publications.html">anticipate
  disconnection</a> when moving out of range, but more work must be done to
  handle disconnections which are not able to be predicted.  The main issue to
  address is the consistency of data that is in transit at the moment a
  disconnection occurs.  Some initial work has been done in this area by Brian
  Mesh.  For more details on this, please contact the Lime authors.
  
<dt><b>Ad hoc routing</b>
<dd> One of the current assumptions in Lime is that all hosts in an ad hoc
  network are directly connected to one another.  In other words, there is
  only one hop in the network between any pair of hosts.  If an ad hoc
  networking layer that supports multicast is added to the infrastructure,
  this assumption can be removed from Lime.  While it is not our intent to
  devise our own ad hoc routing protocol, as work continues in this area in
  the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/manet-charter.html"
  target="_blank"> IETF Manet working group</a> and other places, we expect it
  to positively affect Lime.   

<dt><b>Weaker engagement/disengagement semantics</b>
<dd> In other words, we would like to remove the assumption that engagement
  and disengagement occur as atomic actions.  In many ways this makes Lime more
  amenable to the unpredictable mobile environment and more applicable to
  larger networks where the serialization of each engagement and
  disengagement may cripple meaningful work.  The key difficulty here is in
  precisely defining the new semantics and keeping the result meaningful.
  This also affects the semantics of the consistency of the
  <code>LimeSystem</code> tuple space across connected hosts. 

<dt><b>Enhanced engagement protocols</b> <dd> In addition to working in the ad
  hoc mobile environment, Lime also has potential in a large wide area
  network.  To accommodate this new environment, the weaker engagement and
  disengagement protocols can also be extended with a server-based engagement
  protocol.  The server can either be centralized or distributed, but will
  essentially allow us to remove the multicast to identify a Lime community. By eliminating multicast as the primary mechanism to identify Lime
  communities, we also allow Lime to spread beyond a single local area
  network.<br>
  Another direction for enhancing the engagement protocol is to implement
  an algorithm to join two independent Lime communities.  This contrasts the
  current model in which an individual is able to join an existing group.
  This should also include an enhancement to eliminate the need for
  bootstrapping the Lime system (in other words, each individual would start
  out as a singleton group).
