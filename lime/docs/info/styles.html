<h2>Context</h2>

<i>Context</i> represents the peculiar and novel aspect of mobile
computing. The context of a mobile unit is determined by its current location
which, in turn, defines the environment where the computation associated with
the unit is performed. The context may include resources, services, as well as
other components of the system.  Conventional computing tends to foster a
static notion of context, where changes are absent, small, or predictable. In
a mobile setting, changes in location may lead to sudden changes in the
context a unit perceives.  Moreover, these changes are likely to be abrupt and
unpredictable.  A handheld wireless device carried across the floors of an
office building has access to different resources (e.g., printers or directory
information) on each floor; a mobile agent migrating on different servers may
use different sets of services on each of them; in a fine-grained model, a
statement with free identifiers may be bound to different variable instances
each time it is linked into a different unit of execution.  

<p> In Lime, the context is defined as the set of tuple currently visible to
an agent through its <code>LimeTupleSpace</code>.  This set changes
transparently as the connectivity among hosts changes.  Lime explicitly allows
two flavors of access to data in the <code>LimeTupleSpace</code>:
context-transparent and context-aware. 

<p> A <i>context-transparent</i> Lime application interacts with the changing
tuple space without taking explicit note of the changes.  This is accomplished
by using the standard tuple space operations: <code>out</code>, <code>in</code>,
and <code>rd</code>.  

As the contents of the tuple space changes with the
engagement and disengagement of agents and hosts, these operations are
performed over the changing set of tuples which make up federated tuple space.



<h2>Peer-To-Peer interaction</h2>

Not client-server.



<h2>Reactive Programming</h2>

<p>Mobility enables a highly dynamic environment, where reaction to changes
constitutes a major fraction of the application design. At a first glance, the
Linda model would seem sufficient to provide some degree of reactivity by
representing relevant events as tuples, and by using the <code>in</code>
operation to execute the corresponding reaction as soon as the event tuple
shows up in the tuple space. Nevertheless, in practice this solution has a
number of drawbacks that are well-known in literature, and are a consequence
of the different perspective adopted by Linda, which expects agents to poll
proactively and synchronously the context for new events, rather than specify
the actions to be executed reactively and asynchronously upon occurrence of an
event.

<p> Lime extends tuple spaces with a notion of <i>reaction</i>. A reaction is
defined by an action to be executed when a tuple matching a  pattern is
found in the tuple space.

<p> The semantics of reactions is based on Mobile UNITY reactive statements.
After each operation on the tuple space, a reaction is selected
non-deterministically and the pattern is matched against the content of the
tuple space. If a matching tuple is found, the action is executed, otherwise
the reaction is equivalent to a no-op. This selection and execution proceeds
until there are no reactions enabled, and normal processing of tuple space
operations can resume.  Thus, reactions are executed as if they belonged to a
separate reactive program that is run to fixed point after each non-reactive
statement.  Blocking operations are not allowed in the action sequence, as
they would conflict with the semantics of the processing of reactions, which
must reach termination before standard processing is resumed.  These semantics
offer an adequate level of reactivity, because all the reactions registered
are executed before any other statement of the co-located agents, including
the migration statements. 

<p> The actual form of a reaction is annotated with locations---this has been
omitted so far to keep the discussion simpler. A reaction assumes the form
${\cal R}[\omega,\lambda](s,p)$, where the location parameters have the same
meaning as discussed for \iin and \rrd. However, this kind of reactions,
called \emph{strong reactions} are not allowed on federated tuple spaces; in
other words, the current location field must always be specified, although it
can be the identifier either of a mobile agent or of a mobile host. The reason
for this lies in the constraints introduced by the presence of physical
mobility. If multiple hosts are present, the content of the federated tuple
space spanning them, accessed through the \its of a mobile agent, actually
depends on the content of the tuple space belonging to remote agents. Thus, to
maintain the requirements of atomicity and serialization imposed by reactive
statements would require a distributed transaction encompassing several hosts
for each tuple space operation on any \its---very often, an impractical
solution.

For these reasons, \lime provides also a notion of \emph{weak reaction}. Weak
reactions are used primarily to detect changes to portions of the global
context that involve remote tuple spaces, like the federated tuple space. In
this case, the host where the pattern $p$ is successfully matched against a
tuple, and the host where the corresponding action $s$ is executed are
different. Processing of a weak reaction proceeds like in the case of strong
reactions, except for the fact that the execution of $s$ does not happen
synchronously with the detection of a tuple matching $p$: instead, it is
guaranteed to take place eventually after such condition, if connectivity is
preserved.
