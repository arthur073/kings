<h2>Things to Note</h2>

<ul>
<li>Lime currently uses multicast as the communication mechanism to implement
the engagement and disengagement protocol. Be aware of this when using Lime,
because multicast packets are automatically sent to hosts on the same
subnet. So, if different users are testing different Lime applications on the
same subnet, the engagement packets from one application are likely to
interfere with those of the other.
</ul>

<h2>Current Limitations</h2>

<ul>
<LI>Arbitrary connection and disconnection is currently not supported. Changes
in connectivity are explicitly triggered by the user using the API calls. Work
on a version of Lime that accounts for unannounced disconnection is ongoing. 
<LI>The integration of µCode and Lime currently requires that the classes used
  in tuple fields are already present at the destination. In other words, a mobile
  agent cannot write or access tuples using classes that are not present on the
  file system of the hosting Lime server.  
</ul>
