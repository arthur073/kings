<h1>Research Goals</h1>
<HR>

<P> The current implementation of Lime serves as a proof of concept of global
virtual data structures as an abstraction useful in guiding the development of
middleware for mobile environments, enabling rapid and dependable application
development.  

<dl>
<dt><b>Global Virtual Data Structures</b>
<dd> The underlying model of Lime is one in which coordination takes place via
  a global tuple space physically distributed among mobile units and logically
  partitioned according to connectivity among the units.  This is one example
  of a new coordination concept we refer to a <i>global virtual data
  structures</i>.  This concept starts with the notion of a global,
  persistent, shared data structure accessible to all logically mobile agents
  but distributes it among physically mobile components and provides
  operations for sharing and manipulating the structure based on connectivity.
  While the choice of sharing Linda tuple spaces has proven useful, we
  anticipate applying this strategy to other kinds of data structures such as
  graphs, trees, priority queues, etc. The possibilities are numerous, as is
  the potential for combining these structures into a powerful set of
  interoperable middleware technologies.<br><br>
  
<dt><b>Flexible, Adaptable Mobile Middleware</b>

<dd> Middleware has emerged as a new development tool which can provide
  programmers with the benefits of a powerful virtual machine specialized and
  optimized for tasks common in a particular application setting without the
  major investments associated with the development of application-specific
  languages and systems.  Lime is a new breed of middleware tailored to the
  coordination in the mobile environment.  The key idea is to eliminate the
  programmer's need to be concerned with the details and mechanics of
  communication among mobile hosts and agents, and instead to focus on the
  target computation.  

  <p> We believe that the notion of middleware can be broadened to define a
  layer of abstraction which itself is a layered composition of abstractions.
  This composition should be dynamic and configurable by the application
  programmer.  For example, at the lowest level, middleware can be developed
  to utilize different protocols based on the characteristics of the
  communication media.  For example, in radio communication, broadcast
  protocols have no more overhead than unicast and when possible should be
  exploited in protocols for this environment.  Above this, algorithms can be
  developed to report, with varying degrees of guarantees, current
  connectivity information.  In a logical mobility only setting or a
  physically mobile setting with restricted mobility where disconnections are
  always announced, tight guarantees can be made such that at all times, all
  nodes in the network are guaranteed to have the same view of the network.
  This of course comes at the cost of system-wide synchronization protocols,
  therefore such strong guarantees may not be desired and options for this
  layer of the middleware should include weaker notions of system
  configuration.  At a yet higher level, different devices may have varying
  resource configurations.  Middleware should accommodate this in two ways,
  first by allowing only the essential modules of the middleware to be
  installed on the device, and second by implementing the same high level
  abstractions with different functionality depending on the capabilities of
  the device on which it is executing.  The driving theme is adaptability
  realized through modular middleware which can be pieced together for the
  specific needs of the application and the environment the application is
  running in.
