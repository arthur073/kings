<h1>Starting the Runtime</h1>

<HR><P>

The Lime server embodies the runtime support needed to run applications on a
given host. It is possible to run multiple Lime servers on each host, as long
as they are started on different ports.  This is useful for testing
applications where eventually multiple hosts will be used, but during testing
the hosts are simulated.  The Lime server can be started from within a Java
application, or from the command line using the <a
href="../api/lime/util/Launcher.html" target="Resource
Window"><code>lime.util.Launcher</code></a>. <P>

If the Lime server is started from within a Java application, it runs as a
separate thread within the Java VM that contains the application. Please refer
to the API documentation for <a href="../api/lime/LimeServer.html"
target="Resource Window"><code>lime.LimeServer</code></a> for a description of
the methods available on a <code>LimeServer</code> object.<P>

If the Lime server is launched from the command line, it is executed within a
separate Java VM. Since the actual computation is performed by agents
executing in a Lime server, the problem remains of loading such agents into
the Lime server. There are basically two ways to achieve this with the current
API:

<OL>

<LI><I>Load the application agents when the Lime server is created.</I> <BR>
For instance, <pre>java lime.util.Launcher -load MyAgent1 MyAgent2</pre>

<LI><I>Start the Lime server and, separately, load the application agents into
it.</I> <BR>In one shell, type

<pre>java lime.util.Launcher</pre>

This will start the Lime server with no agents running. In another shell, type

<pre>java lime.util.Launcher -quit -load MyAgent1 MyAgent2</pre>

This will load the agents into an already existing Lime server (the one we
previously started) and then exit immediately.
</OL>

Some things are worth noting in the commands above:

<UL>

<LI><B>Finding the <code>.class</code> files.</B> The argument to the
<code>-load</code> option are one or more <code>.class</code> files, each
containing a subclass of <code>StationaryAgent</code>. (Notice how the
<code>.class</code> suffix is not specified in the parameters.) The bytecode
for the agents must be reachable from the <code>CLASSPATH</code> associated
with the Lime server, otherwise an error is generated.
<LI><B>Using <code>-load</code> and <code>-quit</code>.</B> The
<code>-quit</code> options allows to use an auxiliary Lime server for the sole
purpose of loading one or more agents into an already existing Lime server on
the same host. Notice that the <code>-load</code> option must <I>always</I> be
the last one on the command line.
</UL>

<h2>Launching Mobile Agents</h2>

<p>The text above describe how to launch a server that can contain only
stationary, non-mobile agents. However, Lime allows also for mobile agents, and
actually an <a href="mobileagent.html" target="_blank">adaptation layer</a> has
been developed that in principle allows to use Lime with any mobile agent
system. In the current distribution, the only adapter provided supports the <a href="http://mucode.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">&micro;Code</a>
mobile agent toolkit. Operation of this system with Lime requires a different
launcher, <code>lime.mobileagent.mucode.Launcher</code>, with slightly different
command-line options:<pre>
Usage: java lime.mobileagent.mucode.Launcher 
                       [--mucode [mucode options]]
                       [--lime [lime options]]
                       [--load [class names of agents to be loaded]]
OR     java lime.mobileagent.mucode.Launcher
                       [--send &lt;host:port of target muserver
                               &lt;class names of agent to be loaded remotely&gt;]
For instance:</pre>
<pre>java lime.mobileagent.mucode.Launcher --mucode -port 2000 --lime -port 3000 -debug on --load InteractiveMobileAgent</pre>
loads <code>InteractiveMobileAgent</code> in a mucode server that listens on port 2000, connected with a Lime server (whose debug messages are enabled) listening on port 3000.
<pre>java lime.mobileagent.mucode.Launcher --send localhost:2000 InteractiveMobileAgent InteractiveMobileAgent</pre>
loads (remotely) two additional instances of <code>InteractiveMobileAgent</code> in the mucode server previously
created and then quits.<br>
After this last command, if the three instances of <code>InteractiveMobileAgent</code> engage their tuple
spaces they will all share the same host-level tuple space.<br>
Note:
<ol>
  <li> If specified, the <code>--mucode</code> option must mandatorily come
       before the <code>--lime</code> option, and the
       <code>--load</code> option must be last.<br>

   <li>The <code>--load</code> option causes the mobile agent to be loaded into
       the &micro;code server. The lime option <code>-load</code> instead loads the
       agent directly in the Lime server.

   <li>The <code>--send </code>option performs the remote loading and then
    quits.&nbsp;
</ol>


<P>For additional information about the options available for the &micro;Code
server and the system in general, please see the <a href="http://mucode.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">
