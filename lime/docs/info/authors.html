<p>Lime is the result of a joint research effort led by <a
href="http://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/murphy" target="_blank">Amy L. Murphy</a>,
<a
href="http://www.elet.polimi.it/Users/DEI/Sections/Compeng/GianPietro.Picco/"
target="_blank">Gian Pietro Picco</a>, and <a
href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~roman" target="_blank">Gruia-Catalin Roman</a>,
and has been carried out for the most part when they all were at <a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu" target="_blank">Washington
University</a> in St. Louis, MO, USA.&nbsp;<p>While the three researchers
defined jointly the formal model underlying Lime, the embodying of the model in
a middleware is&nbsp; due to the design and
programming efforts of Amy L. Murphy and Gian Pietro Picco,
who are still coordinating the development of the next releases. The
project is now being carried out as a collaborative effort involving developers in the computer
science departments at <a href="http://www.elet.polimi.it"
target="_blank">Politecnico di Milano</a>, Italy, <a
href="http://www.cs.rochester.edu" target="_blank">University of Rochester</a>,
NY, USA, and <a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu" target="_blank">Washington
University</a> in St. Louis, MO, USA.&nbsp;<p> Several students have been involved in the development of the
demonstration programs included in the software distribution, including Jason Ginchereau
(RedRover, RoamingJigsaw), Brian Mesh (RedRover), and Bryan Payne (RedRover,
Chat). Their work on Lime was part of their undergraduate studies at
Washington University.&nbsp;<a href="http://students.cec.wustl.edu/~clw1">Christine
Julien</a>, a graduate student at Washington University, helped us in writing
some of the documentation and upgrading some the demos as we were extending
Lime.<br>

<h3> More about the project leaders</h3>

<p><b><a href="http://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/murphy/">Amy
L. Murphy</a></b> received a B.S. in Computer Science from the <a
href="http://www.mcs.utulsa.edu/" target="_blank"> University of Tulsa</a> in
1995, and M.S. and D.Sc. degrees from the <a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu"
target="_blank">Department of Computer Science</a> at <a
href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/" target="_blank"> Washington University in
St. Louis, Missouri</a> in 1997 and 2000 respectively.  She is currently an
assistant professor of <a href="http://www.cs.rochester.edu/"
target="_blank">Computer Science</a> at the <a
href="http://www.rochester.edu/" target="_blank"> University of Rochester</a>,
in Rochester, New York where her research interests include the development of
standard algorithms for mobility and the design, specification, and
implementation of mobile middleware systems.  These topics are integrated
under the theme of enabling the rapid development of dependable applications
for both physically and logically mobile
environments.&nbsp;


<p><b><a href="http://www.elet.polimi.it/Users/DEI/Sections/Compeng/GianPietro.Picco/">Gian Pietro Picco</a></b> is an Assistant Professor at the <a
href="http://www.elet.polimi.it" target="_blank">Dipartimento di Elettronica e
Informazione</a>, <a href="http://www.polimi.it" target="_blank">Politecnico
di Milano</a>, Italy. Prior to this current appointment, he was a Visiting
Assistant Professor at the <a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu"
target="_blank">Department of Computer Science</a>, <a
href="http://www.wustl.edu" target="_blank">Washington University in
St. Louis</a>, MO, USA. His research interests are in distributed systems
which exhibit mobility, be it logical or physical. His work in this area thus
far has investigated several aspects spanning from theoretical models to
systems research, and has led to several <a
href="http://www.elet.polimi.it/Users/DEI/Sections/CompEng/GianPietro.Picco/listpub.html"
target="_blank">publications</a>, some of which are widely referenced by the
research community.  
<BR> <b><br>
<a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~roman"> Gruia-Catalin Roman</a></b> was a Fulbright Scholar at the <a
href="htttp://www.upenn.edu/" target="_blank">University of Pennsylvania</a>,
in Philadelphia, where he received a B.S. degree (1973), an M.S. degree
(1974), and a Ph.D. degree (1976), all in computer science.  He has been on
the faculty of the <a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/"
target="_blank">Department of Computer Science</a> at <a
href="http://www.wustl.edu/" target="_blank">Washington University in Saint
Louis </a> since 1976.  Roman is a professor and chairman of the department.
His current research involves the study of formal models, design methods, and
middleware for mobile computing and the development of techniques for the
visualization for distributed computations.  His previous research has been
concerned with models of concurrency, declarative visualization methods,
design methodologies, systems requirements, interactive computer vision
algorithms, formal languages, biomedical simulation, computer graphics, and
distributed databases.  Roman is also a software engineering consultant.  His
list of past clients includes the government and firms in U.S.A. and
Japan. His consulting work involves development of custom software engineering
methodologies and training programs.  Roman is a member of Tau Beta Pi, ACM,
and IEEE Computer Society.</p>
