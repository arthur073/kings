<h1>Lime: Linda in a Mobile Environment</h1>
<HR>

<p> Lime is a Java-based middleware which provides a coordination layer that
can be exploited for designing applications which exhibit either logical or
physical mobility---or both.  Lime is specifically targeted toward the
complexities of the ad hoc mobile environment, however it is applicable beyond
this scope. The driving force in the development of Lime has been the
observation that application design in the physical and logical mobile
environments is complicated due to the constant changes in the availability of
resources (both data and computational elements) as hosts move through space
and mobile agents move among hosts.  Our goal was to simplify programming in
this constantly changing environment by providing a middleware to handle on
behalf of the programmer many of the complexities, while still revealing
enough of the interesting aspects of the mobile environment to remain flexible
and applicable to a wide variety of development projects.

<p> With this goal, we turned toward Linda, a shared memory computing model
developed in the mid 1980's at Yale University, which simplifies distributed
computing.  Our idea is to provide the simple Linda model of coordination in
the mobile environment. The result of our investigation is <b>Lime: Linda in a
Mobile environment.</b>

<p> In Linda, processes communicate by writing, reading, and removing data
from a tuple space that is assumed to be persistent and globally shared among
all processes. Lime adapts this notion to a mobile environment by breaking up
the notion of a global tuple space, and distributing its contents across
multiple mobile components.  When components are within range (i.e., mobile
agents are on the same host or communication is available between mobile hosts
which contain agents), the contents of the tuple spaces held by the individual
mobile components are transiently and transparently shared, forming a
<i>federated tuple space</i>.  The content accessible through such virtual
tuple space, made up of the concrete tuple spaces contributed by each
component, changes from time to time according to the current connectivity
pattern. Lime also introduces the notions of tuple location, for querying a
partition of the federated tuple space, and of reactive programming, for
allowing actions to be performed with varying degrees of atomicity upon
insertion of a tuple.  

<p>The current implementation is kept independent both from the
underlying support for mobile agents and from the underlying tuple space
implementation. In the first case, an <a href="mobileagent.html" target="_blank">adaptation
layer</a> is directly provided in Lime that allows integration of virtually any
mobile agent system. The current release provides an adapter for the <a
href="http://mucode.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">&micro;Code</a> mobile code system.
As for tuple spaces, Lime leverages off of the <a href="http://lights.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">LighTS</a>
package, a tuple space implementation that offers also an adaptation layer
allowing to use different tuple space implementation without changing the
interface. Both <a
href="http://mucode.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">&micro;Code</a>  and <a href="http://lights.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">LighTS</a>
 have been designed and implemented by one of the Lime authors as separate
projects independent from Lime, and are available as <a href="http://www.opensource.org/"
target="_blank">open source</a> on <a href="http://sourceforge.net"
target="_blank">SourceForge</a>.

<p>We hope that you will find the Lime model amenable to the styles of mobile
programs that you want to write.  To learn more, see <a href="nutshell.html">
how it works</a>, or jump into the <a href="../api/index.html"
target="_blank">API documentation</a> to figure it out.  You can also <a
href="download.html">download</a> it and run the <a href="examples.html">
examples.</a> Lime is <a href="http://www.opensource.org/"
target="_blank">open source</a>, with the use of the binaries and source code
regulated by the <a href="license.html">GNU Lesser Public License</a>.
