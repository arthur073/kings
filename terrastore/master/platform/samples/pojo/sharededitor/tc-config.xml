      <!--The app requires these custom objects/classes to be shared - the following declarations
           tell DSO which ones they are. When the app runs under DSO, instances of these classes
           will broadcast changes in their state.

           A best practice (and an MVC pattern) when writing an app that you intend to cluster via Terracotta is to group the 
           classes you want to share under a single package. This makes the list of instrumented classes more concise.-->
      <instrumented-classes>
        <!--The following <include> instruments all of the classes found under the 'demo.sharededitor.models'
             package.-->
        <include>
          <class-expression>demo.sharededitor.models.*</class-expression>
          <honor-transient>true</honor-transient>
        </include>
        <!--Although the class 'demo.sharededitor.models.ObjectManager' is already declared as
             instrumented by the preceding declaration, certain parts of it should only
             be available locally (see the <transient-fields/> section), therefore a
             special declaration of it follows.

             By setting the value of <honor-transient> to 'true', fields declared as transient *are* transient
             and their state and value will not become available across instances of the app. Only local instances of the app
             will be able to create, read, and write to these fields.

             In 'demo.sharededitor.models.ObjectManager', most members (transient and otherwise) are initialized upon creation. 
             However, when DSO finds that an object is already available from the server, additional instances of the app 
             will simply receive a reference to that object, and its constructor will not be called,  Ttransient fields 
             will not be initialized at this point, so the <on-load> declaration is used to indicate actions
             that the class needs to take when DSO loads that object from the server (actions that normally
             happens on class instantiation).-->
