   <h1>Terracotta DSO</h1>
   Shared Work Queue Sample Application

   <h2>About</h2>
   The Shared Work Queue sample application shows how to use Terracotta DSO in a
   web environment to create a list of computation tasks that is worked on by all
   the nodes in the cluster.<br>

   <h2>Build Instructions</h2>
   This sample application ships built ready to run.&nbsp;  If you modify the
   application code, use the provided <code>build.xml</code> file to re-build the
   application with Apache Ant (<code>ant build</code>).

   <h2>Run Instructions</h2>
   <ol>
      <li>Start a Terracotta Server from the <code>samples</code> directory.<br><br>
            Unix:    <samp>./start-demo-server.sh</samp><br>
            Windows: <samp>start-demo-server.bat</samp><br>
      <li>Start multiple copies of application from the <code>samples/pojo/sharedqueue</code> directory.<br><br>
            Unix:    <samp>./run.sh &<br>./run.sh &</samp><br>
            Windows: <samp>run.bat<br>run.bat</samp><br><br>
            Optionally, a port number may be supplied to the run scripts; otherwise a default 
            port number will be used, starting at port 1990, and incremented by 1 for each
            successive copy of the application that you run.<br><br>
      <li>View application.<br>
            Fire up a web browser and point the URL to one of the web servers - if you relied
            on the application to use it's default port number, the following will work:  
            <code>http://localhost:&lt;1990&gt;/webapp/</code><br><br>
            Otherwise replace the value 1990, with the port number that you supplied. You can run
            as many copies of the application as you like, and the number of workers available
            will be reflected on the page.
      <li>Distribute work tasks to clustered processing.<br>
            Enter a value for how many units of work to create.
            Press Start. You can refresh the browser periodically or wait until
            the page refreshes automatically, which is about every quarter of 
            a second. At the bottom, the results demonstrate that the
            processing of the work is automatically split across the nodes of the
            cluster.
