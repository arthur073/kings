      <!-- Our app requires these custom objects/classes to be shared - the following declarations
           tells DSO which ones they are. When the app runs under DSO, instances of these classes
           will broadcast changes in their state.

           A good idiom when writing an app thay you intend to cluster via TC DSO, is to group the 
           classes you wish to share under a single package (although if you follow the MVC pattern
           this tends to happen naturally) - this way the list of classes you wish to instrument
           can be concise 

           Here, we're basically telling DSO to instrument all of the classes for all packages found -->
      <instrumented-classes>
        <include>
          <class-expression>demo.sharedqueue..*</class-expression>
        </include>
      </instrumented-classes>


      <!-- These methods (originating from local objects) operates on objects declared as shared. This 
           section tells DSO to assume a lock on those objects for the duration of the call; essentially this
           section declares that all methods found in the 'demo.sharedqueue.Main' class should assume the 
           behavior described -->
      <locks>
        <autolock>
          <method-expression>* demo.sharedqueue.*.*(..)</method-expression>
        </autolock>
      </locks>

      <!-- We declare the following fields from the 'demo.sharedqueue.Queue' class
           as roots, making it available for all instances of our app that runs via DSO 

           The field 'demo.sharedqueue.Main.lastPortUsed' keeps track of the last port number
           used to launch the web server - subsequent instances of the application will use
           the next port number in the sequence to avoid collision with previous instances -->
