/* The following describes what is required in this file by the
 * ServiceStarter:
 *
 *  - SharedActivationGroupDescriptor, containing the following
 *    required and optional items:
 *
 *      o required String that specifies the policy file to be used
 *        in the activation group VM
 *      o required String that specifies the classpath to be used in
 *        the activation group VM
 *      o required String that specifies the path and filename of the
 *        log for the shared activation group of the service.
 *      o optional String that specifies which VM implementation
 *        (java command) should be used for the service's VM. The
 *        value of this item  must be an absolute path to an executable;
 *        and that executable must accept all the standard VM 
 *        command-line options (for example, -D, -classpath, and so on),
 *        and directly or indirectly start a VM.
 *      o optional String array that specifies the command-line options
 *        the activation system should use when activating the service.
 *        Each of these options must start with a "-" (for example, 
 *        '-classpath <classpath>', '-client', '-server', etc.).
 *      o optional String array that specifies the system properties
 *        to be set on the service's VM by the activation system. Each
 *        of these items must take the form '-D<name>=<value>'.
 *      o optional String that specifies the name of the host on
 *        which the activation system (phoenix) is running
 *      o optional int that specifies the port number on which the
 *        activation system (phoenix) is listening for connection requests
 *
 *    The ServiceDescriptor contains the following required and
 *    optional items:
 *
 *      o SharedActivatableServiceDescriptor
 *      o required String that specifies the codebase to be used in
 *        the service's VM
 *      o required String that specifies the policy file to be used
 *        in the service's VM
 *      o required String that specifies the classpath to be used
 *        in the service's VM
 *      o required String that specifies the impl class name of
 *        the service to be started
 *      o required String that specifies the path and filename of
 *        the log directory for the shared activation group of the
 *        service. This item is used to specify which activation
 *        group VM will host the service
 *      o optional String array that specifies the arguments with 
 *        which to configure the service. Note that the first
 *        element should be the path and filename of the service's
 *        configuration file, and the remaining arguments can be
 *        configuration values that override the values in that
 *        configuration file
 *      o optional boolean that specifies whether or not the
 *        activation system should automatically restart the
 *        service upon a crash
 *
 *  - LoginContext that is used by the ServiceStarter to perform
 *    a JAAS login under the associated Subject
 *
 *    Note: the first element of the first optional String argument
 *          of the ServiceDescriptor represents the location of another
 *          configuration file, different from this config file, that the
 *          service uses for its configuration. The service implementation
 *          retrieves the location of that other configuration file from
 *          its argument list and then performs a number of calls to getEntry
 *          during its initialization, to retrieve the values of the
 *          various configuration entries the service expects (refer to the
 *          javadoc of the service for a list of what the service expects). 
 *          
 *    Note: the optional String array in SharedActivationGroupDescriptor that
 *          specifies the system properties to be set on the service's VM by
 *          the activation system contains the following key/value pairs:
 *            - java.security.debug (optional)
 *            - java.security.auth.login.config
 *            - javax.net.ssl.trustStore
 *            - java.protocol.handler.pkgs
 *            - java.security.properties
 *            - java.util.logging.manager
 *            - java.util.logging.config.file
 *            - serviceClasspath
 *            - serviceConfig
 *            - serverHost
 *            - serviceName
 *            - interfaceName
 *            - implName
 *            - persistDir
 *            - jiniHome
 *            - appHome
 *          These entries are retrieved from the system properties by the
 *          runtime.
 *          
 *    Note: for activatable services, recall that a security manager will
 *          be set automatically by the activation system (otherwise the
 *          optional String array that specifies the system properties to
 *          be set on the service's VM would need to also include a
 *          {"java.security.manager",""} key/value pair). That security
 *          manager will then query the service's policy file whose location is
 *          specified through the java.security.policy property that is set in
 *          the ServiceDescriptor below.
 *         
 *          The RMI runtime will retrieve the value associated here with the
 *          service's java.rmi.server.codebase property. It will use that
 *          codebase property to annotate the remote objects exported by the
 *          service.
 * 
 *          Before the security manager interrogates the policy file, the 
 *          runtime will retrieve a number of system properties that will then
 *          be substituted in the policy file, wherever tokens of the form
 *          ${property name} occur in that file. This substition mechanism
 *          allows some flexibility with respect to starting different services
 *          in different environments.
 *          
 *    Note: should the optional String array in SharedActivationGroupDescriptor
 *          that specifies the system properties to be set on the service's VM
 *          contain a key/value pair of {"java.security.debug", "failure,access"},
 *          then the service will display security debug output to the Phoenix
 *          output display.

     *       preparer (the preparer defined below) to both the

     *       argument), the service will never be successfully
     *       started (because the service's inner proxy will not
     *       be trusted). Thus, the proxy preparer defined below
     *       does not verify trust.
     *
     *       Future implementations of the contributed services
     *       (as well as the ServiceStarter) may be changed in
     *       such a way that trust can be specified here. When/if
