\section Win Windows

PyLinda has only been briefly tested on Windows 2000. It should work on Windows 98, 2000 and XP however.

PyLinda requires that Python 2.3 be install. Python can be obtained free of charge from <a href="http://www.python.org">Python.org</a>.

\section Mac Mac OS X

PyLinda has not been tested by me on Mac OS X, however others have reported success. It can be install by following the regular Unix installation instructions.

PyLinda can also be installed on Mac OS-X using the DarwinPorts ports collection. It can be installed by running the command \c sudo \c port \c install \c py-linda.

\section Other Other

Provided your Unix is supported by Python then PyLinda should run fine. It has been tested on Solaris and no problems were reported.
