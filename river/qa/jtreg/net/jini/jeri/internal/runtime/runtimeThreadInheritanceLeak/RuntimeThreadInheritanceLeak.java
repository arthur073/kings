/* @test 
 * @bug 4404702
 * @summary When the JERI runtime (lazily) spawns system threads that could
 * outlive the application context in which they were (happened to be)
 * created, such threads should not inherit (thread local) data specific to
 * such an application context for various isolation reasons (see 4219095).
 * While there is not yet a practical means for a general solution to this
 * problem, the particular problem documented in 4404702-- the inheritance
 * of the parent thread's context class loader, preventing that loader from
 * being garbage collected in the future-- can be easily fixed.  This test
 * verifies that the context class loader in effect when the first remote
 * object is exported (and thus when some long-lived JERI daemon threads are
 * created) can be garbage collected after the remote object has been
 * unexported.  [Note that this test is somewhat at the mercy of other J2SE
 * subsystems also not holding on to the loader in their daemon threads.]
 *
