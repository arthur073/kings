/**
 * This class determines whether or not the lookup discovery service can
 * successfully add a new set of locators to the set of locators with 
 * which it has been configured to join.
 *
 * This test attempts to add an empty set of locators to the 
 * non-<code>null</code> set of locators with which the service is
 * currently configured.
 *
 * In addition to verifying the capabilities of the service with respect to
 * locator addition, this test also verifies that the <code>addLocators</code>
 * method of the <code>net.jini.discovery.DiscoveryLocatorManagement</code>
 * interface functions as specified. That is, 
 * <p>
 * "If the empty array is input, the managed set of locators will not change".
 *
 * Note that this test class is a sub-class of the test class
 * <code>AddLookupLocators</code>. That parent class performs almost
 * all of the processing for this test. This is because the only
 * difference between this test and the test being performed by the
 * parent class is in the contents of the set of locators with which
 * the lookup discovery service under test is configured. Rather than
 * running one test multiple times, editing a single shared configuration
 * file for each run, running separate tests that perform identical
 * functions but which are associated with different configuration
 * files allows for efficient batching of the test runs. Thus, providing
 * one parent test class from which all other related tests are sub-classed
 * provides for efficient code re-use.
 * 
 * @see <code>com.sun.jini.test.impl.fiddler.joinadmin.AddLookupLocators</code>
