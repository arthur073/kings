/**
 * This class determines whether or not the lookup discovery service can
 * successfully add a new set of groups to the set of groups with which it
 * has been configured to join.
 * 
 * This test attempts to add a finite set of groups containing elements
 * that duplicate at least one element of the initial set groups with
 * which the service is configured.
 *
 * In addition to verifying the capabilities of the service with respect
 * to group addition, this test also verifies that the <code>addGroups</code>
 * method of the <code>net.jini.discovery.DiscoveryGroupManagement</code>
 * interface functions as specified. That is, 
 * <p>
 * "Elements in the input set that duplicate elements already in the managed
 *  set will be ignored."
 * <p>
 * Note that this test class is a sub-class of the <code>AddLookupGroups</code>
 * class. That parent class performs almost all of the processing for this
 * test. This is because the only difference between this test and the test
 * being performed by the parent class is in the contents of the set of
 * groups with which the lookup discovery service under test is configured.
 * Rather than running one test multiple times, editing a single shared
 * configuration file for each run, running separate tests that perform
 * identical functions but which are associated with different configuration
 * files allows for efficient batching of the test runs. Thus, providing
 * one parent test class from which all other related tests are sub-classed
 * provides for efficient code re-use.
