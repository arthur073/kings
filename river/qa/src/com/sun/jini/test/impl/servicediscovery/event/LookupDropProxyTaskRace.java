/**
 * This test attempts to simulate the following race condition that
 * can occur between an instance of LookupTask and an instance of 
 * DropProxyRegTask:
 *
 * - 1 LUS {L0}
 * - 1 service s0 registered in L0
 * - 1 cache C0 with template matching s0
 *
 * Upon creation of the cache, LookupTask is initiated for L0. The test
 * waits a few seconds after the cache is created because if L0 is discarded
 * too quickly, L0 will be removed from the proxyRegSet before LookupTask
 * has a chance to begin any processing. After the wait period is up,
 * L0 is discarded; which initiates the DropProxyRegTask. The race occurs
 * as follows:
 *          LookupTask                       DropProxyRegTask
 *   ----------------------------   ----------------------------------------
 *   o determine s0 is "new"
 *   o sleep for n seconds          o remove L0 from proxyRegSet
 *                                  o serviceIdMap is empty, do nothing else
 *   o add new s0 to serviceIdMap
 *
 * The result is that serviceIdMap should NOT be empty when DropProxyRegTask
 * encounters it. But if LookupTask is too slow in adding s0 to the map,
 * DropProxyRegTask will have nothing to remove, and so will return without
 * modifying serviceIdMap. But when LookupTask returns, s0 will be contained
 * in serviceIdMap; even though it shouldn't.
 *
 * In order to insert the time delay, the SDM must be modified. Also, in
 * order to observe the race, println's must be inserted in the SDM to 
 * display whether the serviceIdMap is empty/non-empty when it is supposed
 * to be empty/non-empty. That is, the pass/fail status of this test cannot
 * be determined by the test itself; it must be observed by the test
 * engineer. Thus, this test will always return a pass status.
 *
 * This test is not part of the regular suite. It must be run manually, with
 * a temporarily-modified SDM.
