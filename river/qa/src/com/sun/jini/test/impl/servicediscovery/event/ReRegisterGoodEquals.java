 * implemented with a well defined ("good") equals() method, the event
 * mechanism of the cache will operate in a predictable fashion, sending
 * a number of serviceAdded and serviceRemoved events.
 *
 * With respect to services defined with a "good" equals() method, the
 * lookup cache will always view different instances of such a service as
 * being the same service since different instances of the service will
 * have the same service ID. Based on this fact, the number of serviceAdded
 * and serviceRemoved events can be computed from the number of services and
 * the number of lookup services with which each service has registered.

     *     for service discovery events from that cache.

     *     notifications have arrived, register a new version of each
     *     of the previously registered services.
     *
     *     That is, each new version should be associated with a new service
     *     value so that the equals() method returns false, but each new
     *     version should have the same service ID as its original counterpart
     *     so that the cache will interpret the different versions as the same
     *     service.
     *  4. Verifies that the expected number of serviceAdded and serviceRemoved
     *     events are sent by the cache.
