/**
 * With respect to the current implementation of the
 * <code>LookupLocatorDiscovery</code> utility, this class verifies
 * that if the <code>discard</code> method is invoked, discovery for the
 * the discarded <code>ServiceRegistrar</code> is delayed.
 *
 * The environment in which this class expects to operate is as follows:
 * <p><ul>
 *   <li> one lookup service
 *   <li> one instance of LookupLocatorDiscovery configured to perform discovery
 *        using the locator for the previously started lookup service.
 *   <li> one DiscoveryListener registered with that LookupLocatorDiscovery.
 *   <li> after discovery, the lookup service is discarded.
 *   <li> after a configured pause, specified by property
 *        com.sun.jini.test.impl.locatordiscovery.discardDelayFirstWait
 *        it makes sure that the LUS is still
 *        undiscovered.
 *   <li> it waits for the LUS to be discovered for a time specified by the
 *        property com.sun.jini.test.impl.locatordiscovery.discardDelay.
 * </ul><p>
 * 
 * If the <code>LookupLocatorDiscovery</code> utility functions as intended,
 * upon invoking the <code>discard</code> method, the rediscovery of the LUS
 * must be appropriately delayed.
