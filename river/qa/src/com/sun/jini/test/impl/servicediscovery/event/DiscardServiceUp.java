/**
 * This class verifies that the <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code> handles
 * the "discard problem" in the manner described in the specification.
 *
 * The discard problem occurs when an entity discards a service from a
 * lookup cache (because the service is unavailable to the entity), but
 * the entity is not really down (the service can still communicate with
 * the lookup services with which it is registered). When this situation
 * occurs, unless the service discovery manager takes steps equivalent to
 * those described in the specification, the service may never be
 * re-discovered (because the service - since it is not actually down -
 * continues to renew its leases with the lookup services, so none of
 * those lookup services will ever re-discover the service).
 * 
 * This class simulates the situation where an entity discards from a
 * lookup cache, a service that never actually goes down. This class then
 * verifies that the service discovery manager identifies the situation
 * and "re-discovers" the previously discarded service.

     *  returns the amount of time to wait for all events to arrive and,
     *  if appropriate, adjusts the value of com.sun.jini.sdm.discardWait.
     *  
     *  The amount time to wait for all events to arrive is dependent on
     *  the following items: the number of services, whether or not those
     *  services will simulate services that have gone down, and the
     *  maximum number of tasks allowed by the manager for the service
     *  discard timer task (which cannot be retrieved from the service
     *  discovery manager). 
     *
     *  For example, if there are 7 services being discarded that do NOT
     *  simulate down services, and if the task manager allows only 5
     *  timer tasks at one time, then 2 service discard tasks will have to
     *  wait for 2 of the initial tasks to complete before those 2
     *  additional can run. Since a service discard timer task exits 
     *  early only if it determines that its corresponding discarded
     *  service is actually down, and since for this example none of the
     *  services go down, each task will run for its full allotted time.
     *  Thus, the amount of time to wait for all events to arrive would
     *  need to be 2 times the maximum amount of time a service discard
     *  task is allowed to run, plus some epsilon [(2*discardWait)+epsion].
     *
     *  For the case where the services do simulate down services, since
     *  the tasks will exit early, the amount of time to wait for all
     *  events to arrive needs to be only (discardWait+epsilon). But
     *  for this case, depending on the number of services and the number
     *  lookup services, it's possible that not all of the expected number
     *  of TRANSITION_MATCH_NOMATCH events (signalling lease expiration)
     *  will arrive before each service discard timer task completes its
     *  wait cycle (that is, the more lookups and services, the longer the
     *  possible delay in events from the lookup services). Thus, for this
     *  case, the value of discardWait itself is adjusted to account for
     *  this situation.
