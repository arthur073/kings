/**
 * This test attempts to simulate the following race condition that
 * can occur between different instances of LookupTask:
 *
 * - 2 LUS's {L0,L1}
 * - 1 service s0 registered in L0 and L1
 * - 1 cache C0 with template matching s0
 *
 * Upon creation of the cache, 2 LookupTasks are queued; one for L0 and
 * one for L1. Both tasks modify the serviceIdMap. Suppose the first task 
 * determines that the service is "new", but before it can update the
 * serviceIdMap, the context switches to the other task. Because the first
 * has not yet updated the serviceIdMap, the second task should then also
 * view the service as new. Thus, because both tasks view the service
 * as new, each task sends a serviceAdded event; when only one is supposed
 * to be sent.
 *
 * The race occurs as follows:
 *
 *                    o L0 created
 *                    o L1 created
 *                    o s0 registered in L0 and L1
 *                    o C0 created with listener and template for s0
 *                    o new C0 initiates a RegisterListener
 *                    o RegisterListenerTask registers for events from {L0,L1}
 *                    o RegisterLisenerTask initiates a LookupTask for {L0,L1}
 *
 *          LookupTask-L0                      LookupTask-L1 
 *   -----------------------------     -----------------------------
 *   o task0 determine s0 is "new"
 *   o sleep for n seconds
 *                                     o task1 determine s0 is "new"
 *                                     o add new s0 to serviceIdMap
 *                                     o send serviceAdded event
 *   o sleep expires
 *   o add new s0 to serviceIdMap
 *   o send serviceAdded event
 *
 * Although this test can be run against an unmodified SDM, the situation
 * described above does not occur consistently unless the SDM is modified
 * to insert a time delay in the appropriate place. 
 * 
 * This class verifies that bug 4675746 has been fixed. As stated in the
 * bug description: "The operations performed in addService() appear NOT
 * to be performed atomically; which may result in a race condition." 
 *
 * This bug was reported by a user who claimed that his application was
 * receiving unexpected duplicate serviceAdded() events for a single service
 * when the service registers with multiple lookup services; indicating a
 * possible race condition in the addService() mechanism.
 *
 * This test attempts to simulate the user's described environment to
 * duplicate the bug prior to a fix being implemented, and to verify that
 * the bug has indeed been fixed after the intended fix has been implemented
 * in the ServiceDiscoveryManager.
