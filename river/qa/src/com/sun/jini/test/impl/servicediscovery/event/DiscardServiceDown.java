/**
 * This class verifies that the <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code> handles
 * the "discard problem" in the manner described in the specification.
 *
 * The discard problem occurs when an entity discards a service from a
 * lookup cache (because the service is unavailable to the entity), but
 * the entity is not really down (the service can still communicate with
 * the lookup services with which it is registered). When this situation
 * occurs, unless the service discovery manager takes steps equivalent to
 * those described in the specification, the service may never be
 * re-discovered (because the service - since it is not actually down -
 * continues to renew its leases with the lookup services, so none of
 * those lookup services will ever re-discover the service).
 * 
 * This class simulates the situation where a service that actually goes
 * down is discarded by an entity. This class then verifies that the service 
 * discovery manager identifies the situation and "commits" the service
 * discard.
