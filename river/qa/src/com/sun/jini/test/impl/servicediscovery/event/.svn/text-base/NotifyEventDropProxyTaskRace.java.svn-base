/**
* This test attempts to simulate the following race condition that
 * can occur between an instance of LookupTask and an instance of 
 * DropProxyRegTask:
 *
 * - 1 LUS {L0}
 * - 1 services {s0}, to be registered in L0
 * - 1 cache C0 with template matching s0
 *
 * This test attempts to simulate the race that appears to be possible
 * between the NotifyEventTask and the DropProxyRegTask. This test 
 * starts lookup L0 and creates cache C0. It then registers s0 with L0
 * to generate a NOMATCH_MATCH event and ultimately initiate an instance
 * of NotifyEventTask. Suppose that before NotifyEventTask can modify the
 * serviceIdMap, L0 is discarded so that the ProxyRegDropTask will be
 * initiated. Without the proposed fix implemented in the SDM, it's then
 * possible that L0 will be discarded before NotifyEventTask inserts the
 * mapping { [s0,L0] } in serviceIdMap, which may result (if the timing is
 * right) in NotifyEventTask placing { [s0,L0] } in serviceIdMap after L0
 * has been discarded; which means tha contents of serviceIdMap will be
 * inconsistent, and the serviceRemoved event that should occur because
 * of the discard, will never actually occur.
 *
 * The race occurs as follows:
 *
 *                          o L0 created
 *                          o C0 created
 *                          o s0 registered with L0
 *                          o L0 sends NO_MATCH_MATCH
 *
 *          NotifyEventTask                       DropProxyRegTask
 *   -----------------------------     ----------------------------------------
 *   o task0 determine s0 is "new"
 *   o sleep for n seconds
 *                          o L0 is discarded
 *                                     o remove L0 from proxyRegSet
 *                                     o serviceIdMap is empty, do nothing else
 *                                     o thinking map should be empty, return
 *   o add new s0 to serviceIdMap
 *   o map NOT empty now but should be
 *
 * The result is that serviceIdMap should be empty and L0 should not be 
 * in proxyRegSet. But if NotifyEventTask is too slow in processing the
 * new s0, DropProxyRegTask will have nothing to process and so the
 * serviceIdMap will not be empty, and the serviceRemoved event that should
 * have been sent because the [s0,L0] pair was removed from the serviceIdMap
 * is never sent.
 *
 * Although this test can be run against an unmodified SDM, the situation
 * described above does not occur consistently unless the SDM is modified
 * to insert a time delay in the appropriate place.
