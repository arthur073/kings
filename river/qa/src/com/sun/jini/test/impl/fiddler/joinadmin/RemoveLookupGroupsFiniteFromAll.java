/**
 * This class determines whether or not the lookup discovery service can
 * successfully remove a set of groups from the set of groups with which
 * it has been configured to join.
 * 
 * This test attempts to remove a finite set of groups from the set of
 * groups with which the service is currently configured to join, where
 * the service's current set of groups is represented by 
 * <code>ALL_GROUPS</code> (<code>null</code>).
 * 
 * In addition to verifying the capabilities of the service with respect to
 * group removal, this test also verifies that the <code>removeGroups</code>
 * method of the <code>net.jini.discovery.DiscoveryGroupManagement</code>
 * interface functions as specified. That is, 
 * <p>
 * "This method throws an <code>UnsupportedOperationException</code> if
 * there is no managed set of groups from which to remove elements."
 * <p>
 * Note that this test class is a sub-class of <code>RemoveLookupGroups</code>.
 * That parent class performs almost all of the processing for this
 * test. This is because the only difference between this test and the test
 * being performed by the parent class is in the contents of the set of
 * groups with which the lookup discovery service under test is configured.
 * Rather than running one test multiple times, editing a single shared
 * configuration file for each run, running separate tests that perform
 * identical functions but which are associated with different configuration
 * files allows for efficient batching of the test runs. Thus, providing
 * one parent test class from which all other related tests are sub-classed
 * provides for efficient code re-use.
 *
