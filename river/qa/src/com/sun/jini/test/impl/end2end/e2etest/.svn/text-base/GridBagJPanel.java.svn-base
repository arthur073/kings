/**
 *<pre>
 *  GridBagJPanel
 *
 *  class to simplify using the GridBagLayout manager and make the
 *  application code more readable
 *
 *  extends JPanel by adding a method, add, which accepts a
 *  string representation of the constraints. For example a call which
 *  looks like:
 *
 *  fooPanel.add(new Canvas(),"w=1 h=1 a=n in=10,5,10,5")
 *
 *  will add a canvas to the panel fooPanel, with:
 *	gridwidth = 1
 *	gridheight = 1
 *	anchor = NORTH
 *	insets = 10,5,10,5
 *
 * all other parameters will take default values
 *
 * magic string tokens:
 *  w = gridwidth, takes an int or one of the tokens rem (REMAINDER)
 *      or rel (RELATIVE)
 *  h = gridheight, ditto
 *  x = gridx, takes an int or the token rel
 *  y = gridy, ditto
 *  f = fill, takes one of the tokens none hor (HORIZONTAL) ver (VERTICAL) both
 *  a = anchor, takes one of n s e w ne nw se sw c for the compass point
 *  ix= ipadx, takes an int
 *  iy= ipady, takes an int
 *  in= insets, takes four ints separated by commas
 *  wx= weightx, takes an int or a float
 *  wy= weighty, ditto
 *
 * a parse error generates an IllegalArgumentException. This makes
 * error detection simple during development, without cluttering up the
 * code with try/catch blocks to catch exceptions which would never occur
 * in production
 *
 * the constructor automatically creates a GridBagLayout manager for the
 * GridBagPanel, so it is unnecessary to use setLayout to add one.
