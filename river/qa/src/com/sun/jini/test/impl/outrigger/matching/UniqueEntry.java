/**
 * Base class to be used for JavaSpace entries that require identity
 * and are not naturally unique.  The nature of JavaSpaces (deals in
 * copies of entries, all of an entries fields are public, etc.)
 * requires some invariants to be maintained by the client to
 * guarantee the uniqueness of UniqueEntry's.
 *
 * <UL>
 * <LI> Clients should only write <code>UniqueEntry</code>s that they
 * have :
 *      <UL>
 *      <LI> obtained from <code>UniqueEntry(true)</code>, or the
 *           constructor of a subclass that called super(true).
 *      <LI> <em>taken</em> from the JavaSpace.
 *      </UL>
 * <LI> Clients should not write the same <code>UniqueEntry</code> (or
 *      copy of) to a JavaSpace more than once without an intervening
 *      take.
 * </UL>
 *
 * Another way to look at this class is that it allows clients to fake
 * mutable entries.  By giving each entry a unique identity one can
 * match up solely on the UniqueEntry portion of the entry, this allows
 * a client to look-up the correct entry even if it has changed.  The
 * <code>UniqueEntry(UniqueEntry)</code> constructor is provide to
 * produce template for exactly this purpose.
