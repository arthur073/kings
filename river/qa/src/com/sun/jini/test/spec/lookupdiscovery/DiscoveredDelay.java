/**
 * This class verifies that the <code>LookupDiscovery</code> utility
 * operates in a manner consistent with the specification. In particular,
 * this class verifies that the lookup discovery utility can successfully
 * employ the multicast discovery protocol on behalf of a client to discover
 * both lookup services that already exist when the utility is constructed,
 * and lookup services that are started after the utility is created.
 *
 * The environment in which this class expects to operate is as follows:
 * <p><ul>
 *    <li> one or more "initial" lookup services, each belonging to a finite
 *         set of member groups, and each started during setup, before the
 *         test begins execution
 *    <li> one or more "additional" lookup services, each belonging to a finite
 *         set of member groups, and each started after the test has begun
 *         execution, and after the initial lookup services started during
 *         setup have been discovered
 *    <li> one instance of the lookup discovery utility
 *    <li> the lookup discovery utility is configured to discover the
 *         member groups of each lookup service that is to be started
 *    <li> one instance of DiscoveryListener registered with the lookup
 *         discovery utility
 * </ul><p>
 * 
 * If the lookup discovery utility functions as specified, then the listener
 * will receive the expected discovery events, with the expected contents.
