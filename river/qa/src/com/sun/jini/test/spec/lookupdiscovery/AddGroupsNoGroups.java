/**
 * With respect to the <code>addGroups</code> method, this class verifies
 * that the <code>LookupDiscovery</code> utility operates in a manner
 * consistent with the specification. In particular, this class verifies
 * that invoking the <code>addGroups</code> method with an empty array
 * (<code>NO_GROUPS</code>) has no effect on the set of groups the
 * <code>LookupDiscovery</code> utility is currently configured to discover.
 *
 * The environment in which this class expects to operate is as follows:
 * <p><ul>
 *    <li> no lookup services
 *    <li> one instance of the lookup discovery utility
 *    <li> the lookup discovery utility is initially configured to discover
 *         a finite set of groups (not NO_GROUPS and not ALL_GROUPS)
 * </ul><p>
 * 
 * If the lookup discovery utility functions as specified, then after
 * invoking the <code>addGroups</code> method with the empty array
 * (<code>NO_GROUPS</code>), there will be no change in the set of 
 * groups the lookup discovery utility is configured to discover.
