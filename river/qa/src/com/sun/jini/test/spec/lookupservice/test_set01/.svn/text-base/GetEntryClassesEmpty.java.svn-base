/** This class is used to verify that the method getEntryClasses() operates
 *  as expected when an "empty" template is input.
 *
 *  In particular, this test wishes to verify the following statement from
 *  the lookup specification:
 *
 *    "The getEntryClasses method looks at all service items that match the
 *     specified template, finds every entry (among those service items)
 *     that either doesn't match any entry templates or is a subclass of
 *     at least one matching entry template, and returns the set of the 
 *     (most specific) classes of those entries ..."
 *  
 *  The difference between this test class and the other classes that
 *  test getEntryClasses() is in the template that is used for matching
 *  the registered services. This class will input a template containing
 *  "wild cards" in all fields; whereas the other test classes will employ
 *  templates that match on other criteria.
 * 
 *  To perform this test, N instances of each of the test service classes
 *  are created and registered with the lookup service. Each of the test
 *  attribute classes are instantiated and added to each of the services.
 *  That is, each of the N instances of the M services has assigned to it
 *  L different attributes. An empty template is created. For each of the
 *  service classes, getEntryClasses() is called with the empty template 
 *  as input argument. The array of class types that is returned is then
 *  compared against the expected set of class type descriptors.
