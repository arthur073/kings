/** This class verifies that the <code>LookupDiscovery</code> utility
 *  monitors the multicast announcements sent from lookup services
 *  in a manner consistent with the specification. In particular, this
 *  class verifies that when the lookup discovery utility stops receiving
 *  multicast announcements from a lookup service, even if that lookup
 *  service is still running and reachable, if it no longer belongs to
 *  any of the groups the lookup discovery utility is currently interested
 *  in discovering, the lookup discovery utility will discard that lookup
 *  service.
 *
 *  Note that this class verifies only one aspect of the multicast monitoring
 *  mechanism provided by the lookup discovery utility: upon determining 
 *  that multicast announcements have ceased being received, the lookup
 *  discovery utility will test the associated lookup service for
 *  reachability; and will discard that lookup service only if that
 *  lookup service is unreachable, or no longer belongs to any of the
 *  current groups of interest.  Full verification of the multicast
 *  announcement monitoring mechanism is acheived through the combination
 *  of the lookup discovery utility test classes whose names are prefixed
 *  with 'MulticastMonitor'.
 *
 *  The environment in which this class expects to operate is as follows:
 *  <p><ul>
 *   <li> one or more lookup services, each belonging to a finite set of
 *        member groups
 *   <li> one instance of LookupDiscovery configured to discover the union
 *        of the member groups to which each lookup service belongs 
 *   <li> one DiscoveryListener registered with the lookup discovery utility
 *   <li> after discovery, the generation of multicast announcements is 
 *        stopped and the lookup services associated with those announcements
 *        remain reachable, but the member groups of those lookup services
 *        are replaced with a set of groups containing NONE of the groups
 *        the lookup discovery utility is currently interested in discovering
 *  </ul><p>
 * 
 * If the <code>LookupDiscovery</code> utility functions as specified,
 * then even though the lookup discovery utility no longer receives
 * mulitcast announcements from the previously discovered lookup services,
 * and even though those lookup services are determined to still be reachable,
 * because those lookup services no longer belong to any of the groups of
 * interest, the lookup discovery utility will discard each of those lookup
 * services.
