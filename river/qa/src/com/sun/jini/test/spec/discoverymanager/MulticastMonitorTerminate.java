/**
 * This class verifies that the <code>LookupDiscoveryManager</code> utility
 * handles, in a manner consistent with the specification, the "passive" 
 * discarded events that occur as a result of the termination of discovered
 * lookup services and the multicast announcements those lookups broadcast.
 * 
 * The environment in which this class expects to operate is as follows:
 * <p><ul>
 *    <li> N lookup services having locator L0i, and belonging to groups
 *         {G0i,G1i,G2i}, where i = 0 ... N
 *    <li> one lookup discovery manager configured to discover some of the
 *         lookups by only group discovery, some by only locator discovery,
 *         and some by both group and locator discovery
 *    <li> one instance of DiscoveryListener registered with the lookup
 *         discovery manager
 *    <li> after discovery, each lookup service is destroyed, rendering it
 *         unreachable
 * </ul><p>
 * 
 * If the lookup discovery manager functions as specified, then the client's
 * listener will receive the expected number of discarded events, with the
 * expected contents.
