/**
 * With respect to the <code>removeLocators</code> method, this class
 * verifies that the <code>LookupLocatorDiscovery</code> utility operates
 * in a manner consistent with the specification. In particular, this class
 * verifies that upon invoking the <code>removeLocators</code> method to
 * remove some (but not all) of the locators with which the lookup locator
 * discovery utility was previously configured to discover, that utility will
 * send discarded events referencing the previously discovered lookup services
 * whose locators correspond to the locators that were removed.
 *
 * The environment in which this class expects to operate is as follows:
 * <p><ul>
 *   <li> one or more lookup services
 *   <li> one instance of LookupLocatorDiscovery configured to discover the
 *        set of locators whose elements are the locators of each lookup
 *        service that was started
 *   <li> one DiscoveryListener registered with that LookupLocatorDiscovery
 *   <li> after discovery, removeLocators is invoked to remove some (but not
 *        all) of the locators with which the lookup locator discovery utility
 *        was originally configured to discover
 * </ul><p>
