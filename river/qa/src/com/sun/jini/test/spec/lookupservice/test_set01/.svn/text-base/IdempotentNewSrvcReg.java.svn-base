/** This class is used to test that the process of registering a NEW service 
 *  is an IDEMPOTENT process.
 *  
 *  When a service registration is requested of the Lookup service by a
 *  client process, there are a number of conditions that can cause the
 *  client to view the registration as a failure; and as a result, re-register
 *  the service. Some of those conditions are:
 *  
 *     -- The server or the network could go down before the registration
 *        request arrives on the "server side". In this case, the state of
 *        the server never changes.
 *     -- The server or network could go down after the server receives the
 *        request, but before the server sends a reply. In this case, the
 *        state of the server can change, but the client is never aware of
 *        the change.
 *        
 *  No matter what the cause is, the client will receive a RemoteException
 *  if the registration is not successful; that is, if the invocation of
 *  of the remote registration method does not succeed. When such failures
 *  occur, the client will re-register the service. It is a requirement that
 *  the register() method of the Lookup service be defined "so that it can
 *  be used in an idempotent fashion. Specifically, if a call results in a
 *  RemoteException (in which case the item might or might not have been 
 *  registered), the caller can simply repeat the call with the same
 *  parameters", and the results will be the same as if the registration
 *  succeeded on the first call.
 *  
 *  This test will NOT bring down the network; nor will the server code be
 *  modified to simulate the conditions described above. This test will
 *  register a set of services and then "pretend" that the registration
 *  did not succeed. It will then re-register those same services and 
 *  verify that the second registration produced the same results as the
 *  first registration. It is in this way that the conditions described
 *  above will be simulated and the idempotency of the registration process
 *  will be proven.
 *
 *  Note that this test both registers and re-registers the services with
 *  ASSIGN_SERVICE_ID set in the serviceID argument (ASSIGN_SERVICE_ID 
 *  requests that the Lookup service assign the next available service ID
 *  to the service being registered). This is done because we are testing
 *  for idempotency of the registration of NEW services.
