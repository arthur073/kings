/**
 * <pre>
 * Purpose
 *   This test verifies the following:
 *     'grant(Class fromClass, Class toClass)' static method of Security class
 *     does the following: if the installed security policy provider implements
 *     the DynamicPolicy interface, takes the set of permissions dynamically
 *     granted to the class loader of fromClass with the current subject's
 *     principals, determines which of those permissions the calling context is
 *     authorized to grant, and dynamically grants that subset of the
 *     permissions to the class loader of toClass, qualified with the current
 *     subject's principals. The current subject is determined by calling
 *     Subject.getSubject method on the context returned by
 *     AccessController.getContext method; the permissions dynamically granted
 *     to fromClass are determined by calling the getGrants method of the
 *     currently installed policy, and the permission grant to toClass is
 *     performed by invoking the grant method of the current policy. It throws
 *     UnsupportedOperationException if currently installed policy does not
 *     support dynamic permission grants, throws NullPointerException if
 *     fromClass or toClass is null.
 *
 * Infrastructure
 *   This test requires the following infrastructure:
 *     NonDynamicPolicyProvider - policy provider which does not implement
 *             DynamicPolicy interface
 *     TestDynamicPolicyProvider - policy provider implementing DynamicPolicy
 *             interface having constructor with 1 parameter: Permission[],
 *             which is returned by 'getGrants' method
 *
 * Action
 *   The test performs the following steps:
 *     1) invoke 'grant(Class fromClass, Class toClass)' static method of
 *        Security class with null fromClass and non-null toClass
 *     2) assert that NullPointerException will be thrown
 *     3) invoke 'grant(Class fromClass, Class toClass)' static method of
 *        Security class with non-null fromClass and null toClass
 *     4) assert that NullPointerException will be thrown
 *     5) invoke 'grant(Class fromClass, Class toClass)' static method of
 *        Security class with null fromClass and null toClass
 *     6) assert that NullPointerException will be thrown
 *     7) set current policy provider to NonDynamicPolicyProvider
 *     8) invoke 'grant(Class fromClass, Class toClass)' static method of
 *        Security class with non-null fromClass and non-null toClass
 *     9) assert that UnsupportedOperationException will be thrown
 *     10) construct TestDynamicPolicyProvider1 with array of Permissions,
 *         containing only permissions the calling context is
 *         authorized to grant
 *     11) set current policy provider to TestDynamicPolicyProvider1
 *     12) invoke 'grant(Class fromClass, Class toClass)' static method of
 *         Security class with non-null fromClass and non-null toClass
 *     13) assert that 'getGrants' method of TestDynamicPolicyProvider1 will
 *         be invoked with fromClass, and Principal[] parameter
 *         containing the same set of principals as Subject.getSubject method
 *         on the context returned by AccessController.getContext method
 *     14) assert that 'grant(Class, Principal[], Permission[])' method of
 *         TestDynamicPolicyProvider1 will be invoked with class=toClass,
 *         Principal[] parameter containing the same set of principals as
 *         Subject.getSubject method on the context returned by
 *         AccessController.getContext method and the same array of Permissions
 *         which was returned by 'getGrants' method call
 *     15) construct TestDynamicPolicyProvider2 with array of Permissions,
 *         containing permissions both permissions the calling context is
 *         authorized to grant and ones which are not granted
 *     16) set current policy provider to TestDynamicPolicyProvider2
 *     17) invoke 'grant(Class fromClass, Class toClass)' static method of
 *         Security class with non-null fromClass and non-null toClass
 *     18) assert that 'getGrants' method of TestDynamicPolicyProvider2 will
 *         be invoked with fromClass, and Principal[] parameter
 *         containing the same set of principals as Subject.getSubject method
 *         on the context returned by AccessController.getContext method
 *     19) assert that 'grant(Class, Principal[], Permission[])' method of
 *         TestDynamicPolicyProvider2 will be invoked with class=toClass,
 *         Principal[] parameter containing the permissions array containing
 *         only those permissions which current context is authorized to grant
