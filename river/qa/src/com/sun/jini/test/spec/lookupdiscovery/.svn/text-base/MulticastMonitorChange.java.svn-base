/**
 * This class verifies that the <code>LookupDiscovery</code> utility
 * monitors the multicast announcements sent from the lookup service
 * in a manner consistent with the specification. In particular, this
 * class verifies that when a lookup discovery utility is configured to
 * notify an instance of <code>DiscoveryChangeListener</code> of group
 * membership changes occurring in the lookup services previously discovered,
 * through the contents of the multicast announcements received, the lookup
 * discovery utility can determine when the member groups of those lookup
 * services have changed from the original finite set of member groups
 * to a new set containing only a SUBSET of the original member groups, and
 * will send to the listener, changed events referencing the correct changed
 * event information corresponding to each such lookup service.
 *
 * The environment in which this class expects to operate is as follows:
 * <p><ul>
 *    <li> one or more lookup services, each belonging to a finite set of
 *         member groups
 *    <li> one instance of LookupDiscovery configured to discover the union
 *         of the member groups to which each lookup service belongs 
 *    <li> one DiscoveryChangeListener registered with the lookup discovery
 *         utility
 *    <li> after discovery, the set of member groups of each the lookup
 *         services started by this test is changed to a set in which SOME
 *         of the elements equals one of the original member groups used
 *         when starting the lookup services, and some of the elements 
 *         equal none of the original member groups of that lookup service
 * </ul><p>
 * 
 * If the <code>LookupDiscovery</code> utility functions as specified,
 * then because the previously discovered lookup services have had their
 * group memberships changed, the lookup discovery utility will send to
 * the listener, changed events referencing the correct changed event
 * information corresponding to each lookup service whose group membership
 * has changed.
