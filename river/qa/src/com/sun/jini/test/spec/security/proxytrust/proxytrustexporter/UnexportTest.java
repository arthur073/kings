/**
 * <pre>
 * Purpose
 *   This test verifies the following:
 *     The unexport method of the main exporter is called with the specified
 *     argument and if that returns true, the unexport method of the bootstrap
 *     exporter is called with true. The result of the main unexport call is
 *     returned by this method.
 *
 * Infrastructure
 *   This test requires the following infrastructure:
 *     UnexportTrueExporter - exporter whose unexport method always returns true
 *     UnexportSameExporter - exporter whose unexport method returns the same
 *             value as parameter specified
 *
 * Action
 *   The test performs the following steps:
 *     1) construct ProxyTrustExporter1 with UnexportTrueExporter as a parameter
 *        for mainExporter and UnexportSameExporter as a parameter for
 *        bootExporter
 *     2) invoke unexport method of constructed ProxyTrustExporter1
 *        with 'true' as a parameter
 *     3) assert that unexport methods of both UnexportTrueExporter and
 *        UnexportSameExporter will be invoked
 *     4) assert that true will be returned by unexport method invocation
 *     5) invoke unexport method of constructed ProxyTrustExporter1
 *        with 'false' as a parameter
 *     6) assert that unexport methods of both UnexportTrueExporter and
 *        UnexportSameExporter will be invoked
 *     7) assert that true will be returned by unexport method invocation
 *     8) construct ProxyTrustExporter2 with UnexportSameExporter as a parameter
 *        for mainExporter and UnexportTrueExporter bootExporter
 *     9) invoke unexport method of constructed ProxyTrustExporter2
 *        with 'false' as a parameter
 *     10) assert that only unexport methods of UnexportSameExporter will be
 *         invoked
 *     11) assert that false will be returned by unexport method invocation
 * </pre>
