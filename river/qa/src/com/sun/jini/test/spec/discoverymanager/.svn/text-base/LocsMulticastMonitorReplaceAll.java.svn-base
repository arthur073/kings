/**
 * This class verifies that the <code>LookupDiscoveryManager</code> utility
 * monitors, in a manner consistent with the specification, the mulitcast
 * announcements received from lookup services it has discovered.
 * <p>
 * In particular, this test verifies that when the member groups of a
 * discovered lookup service are changed to a set containing NONE of the
 * lookup service's original member groups, if the lookup discovery manager
 * is configured to discover ALL_GROUPS, then the lookup discovery manager
 * will send a changed event (rather than a discarded event) containing
 * the appropriate contents.
 * 
 * The environment in which this class expects to operate is as follows:
 * <p><ul>
 *    <li> N lookup services having locator L0i, and belonging to groups
 *         {G0i,G1i,G2i}, where i = 0 ... N
 *    <li> one lookup discovery manager configured to discover ALL_GROUPS,
 *         and also configured to discover all of the lookups by locator
 *         discovery as well
 *    <li> one instance of DiscoveryChangeListener registered with the lookup
 *         discovery manager
 *    <li> after discovery, each set of member groups is completely replaced
 *         with a new set
 * </ul><p>
 * 
 * If the lookup discovery manager functions as specified, then the client's
 * listener will receive the expected number of changed events, with the
 * expected contents.
