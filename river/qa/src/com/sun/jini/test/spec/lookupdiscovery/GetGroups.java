/**
 * With respect to the <code>getGroups</code> method, this class verifies
 * that the <code>LookupDiscovery</code> utility operates in a manner
 * consistent with the specification. In particular, this class verifies
 * that the <code>getGroups</code> method returns a <code>String</code>
 * array in which each element of the array equals the name of a member
 * group containing the lookup services the lookup discovery utility is
 * currently configured to discover.
 *
 * The environment in which this class expects to operate is as follows:
 * <p><ul>
 *    <li> no lookup services
 *    <li> one instance of the lookup discovery utility
 *    <li> the lookup discovery utility is initially configured to discover
 *         a finite set of groups (not NO_GROUPS and not ALL_GROUPS)
 * </ul><p>
 * 
 * If the lookup discovery utility functions as specified, then invoking
 * the <code>getGroups</code> method should return the member groups
 * with which the lookup discovery utility is currently configured to
 * discover.
