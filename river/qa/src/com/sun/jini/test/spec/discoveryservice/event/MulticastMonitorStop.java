/**
 * This class verifies that the lookup discovery service operates in a manner
 * consistent with the specification. In particular, this class verifies
 * that the lookup discovery service can successfully employ both the
 * multicast and unicast discovery protocols on behalf of one or more clients
 * registered with that service to discover a number of pre-determined lookup
 * services and then, for each discovered lookup service, send to the 
 * appropriate registration listener, the appropriate remote event containing
 * the set of member groups with which the discovered lookup service was
 * configured.
 *
 * The environment in which this class expects to operate is as follows:
 * <p><ul>
 *   <li> one or more lookup services, each belonging to a finite set of
 *        member groups
 *   <li> one instance of the lookup discovery service
 *   <li> one or more registrations with the lookup discovery service
 *   <li> each registration with the lookup discovery service requests that
 *        some of the lookup services be discovered through only group
 *        discovery, some through only locator discovery, and some through
 *        both group and locator discovery
 *   <li> each registration with the lookup discovery service will receive
 *        remote discovery events through an instance of RemoteEventListener
 * </ul><p>
 * 
 * If the lookup discovery service utility functions as specified, then
 * for each discovered lookup service, a <code>RemoteDiscoveryEvent</code>
 * instance indicating a discovered event will be sent to the listener of
 * each registration that requested discovery of the lookup service.
 * Additionally, each event received will accurately reflect the new set
 * of member groups.
