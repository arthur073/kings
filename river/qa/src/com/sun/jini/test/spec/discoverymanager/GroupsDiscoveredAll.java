/**
 * This class verifies that the <code>LookupDiscoveryManager</code> utility
 * operates in a manner consistent with the specification.
 * <p>
 * In particular, this class verifies that the lookup discovery manager can
 * successfully employ the multicast discovery protocol on behalf of a client
 * to discover a number of pre-determined lookup services using ONLY group
 * discovery when the lookup discovery manager is configured to discover
 * ALL_GROUPS; and then for each discovered lookup service, send to the
 * client's listener, the appropriate discovery event with the appropriate
 * contents.
 *
 * The environment in which this class expects to operate is as follows:
 * <p><ul>
 *    <li> N lookup services having locator L0i, and belonging to groups
 *         {G0i,G1i,G2i}, where i = 0 ... N
 *    <li> one lookup discovery manager configured to use only group discovery
 *         to discover ALL_GROUPS
 *    <li> one instance of DiscoveryListener registered with the lookup
 *         discovery manager
 * </ul><p>
 * 
 * If the lookup discovery manager utility functions as specified, then
 * the client's listener will receive the expected number of discovery events,
 * with the expected contents.
