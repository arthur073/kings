/**
 * This class verifies that the <code>LookupLocatorDiscovery</code>
 * utility operates in a manner consistent with the specification.
 * In particular, this class verifies that after invoking the 
 * <code>removeDiscoveryListener</code> method to remove a listener
 * registered with a lookup locator discovery utility, the listener that
 * was removed will receive no more discovered events from the lookup
 * locator discovery utility from which that listener was removed.
 * <p>
 * The environment in which this class expects to operate is as follows:
 * <p><ul>
 *   <li> one or more initial lookup services started during setup
 *   <li> one or more additional lookup services to be started after
 *        the listener has been removed
 *   <li> an instance of the lookup locator discovery utility configured to
 *        discover all lookup services that are to be started
 *   <li> two instances of DiscoveryListener registered with the lookup
 *        locator discovery utility: one used to verify the continued 
 *        operation of discovery processing, one to be removed from
 *        the lookup locator discovery utility
 * </ul><p>
 * 
 * If the lookup locator discovery utility functions as specified, then 
 * after removing the listener from the lookup locator discovery utility,
 * the removed listener will receive no more discovered events.
