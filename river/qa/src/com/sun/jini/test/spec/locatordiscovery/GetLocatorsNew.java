 *    <li> an instance of the lookup locator discovery utility that is
 *         constructed using an array of locators consistent with the

 * 
 * If the lookup locator discovery utility functions as specified, then on
 * each separate invocation of the <code>getLocators</code> method, a new
 * array containing the <code>LookupLocator</code> instances with which the
 * lookup locator discovery utility is configured to discover will be returned.
