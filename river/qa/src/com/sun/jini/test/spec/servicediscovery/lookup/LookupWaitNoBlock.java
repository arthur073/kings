/**
 * With respect to the <code>lookup</code> method defined by the 
 * <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code> utility class, this class verifies
 * that the blocking version that returns a single instance of
 * <code>ServiceItem</code> operates as specified when invoked under
 * the following condition:
 * <p><ul>
 *    <li> template matching performed by the service discovery manager is
 *         based on service type only
 *    <li> the service discovery manager applies no filtering to the results
 *         of the template matching
 *    <li> at least 1 matching service is already available for discovery
 *         when the lookup method is called
 * </ul><p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *    ServiceItem lookup(ServiceTemplate tmpl,
 *                       ServiceItemFilter filter,
 *                       long waitDur);
 * </pre>
 *
 * If at least 1 matching service is already available to be discovered when
 * the <code>lookup</code> method is called (that is, the <code>lookup</code>
 * method does not have to wait for the desired service to be registered),
 * then the <code>lookup</code> method will not block. In that case, the
 * <code>lookup</code> method should return immediately after discovering
 * the desired service.
