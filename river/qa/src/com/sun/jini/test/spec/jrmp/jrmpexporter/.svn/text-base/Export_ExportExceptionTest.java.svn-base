/**
 * <pre>
 * Purpose
 *   This test verifies the following:
 *     JrmpExporter.export method will throw ExportException if some problem
 *     occurs while exporting the object.
 *
 * Test Cases
 *   This test uses different constructors to construct JrmpExporter.
 *
 * Infrastructure
 *   This test requires the following infrastructure:
 *     TestRemoteObjectWithoutStub - class which implements java.rmi.Remote
 *     interface without generating stub class.
 *
 * Action
 *   For each test case the test performs the following steps:
 *     1) construct a JrmpExporter
 *     2) construct TestRemoteObjectWithoutStub
 *     3) invoke export method from constructed JrmpExporter with constructed
 *        TestRemoteObjectWithoutStub as a parameter
 *     4) assert that ExportException will be thrown
 * </pre>
