/**
 * With respect to the <code>setLocators</code> method, this class verifies
 * that the <code>LookupLocatorDiscovery</code> utility operates in a manner
 * consistent with the specification. In particular, this class verifies
 * that upon invoking the <code>setLocators</code> method to re-configure
 * the <code>LookupLocatorDiscovery</code> utility to discover a new set of
 * locators which replaces the current set of locators to discover, and
 * which contains NONE of the locators with which it was previously configured,
 * that utility will send discarded events referencing the previously
 * discovered lookup services whose locators do not belong to the new set
 * of locators to discover (that is, discarded events will be sent for all 
 * of the previously discovered lookup services).
 *
 * The environment in which this class expects to operate is as follows:
 * <p><ul>
 *   <li> one or more lookup services
 *   <li> one instance of LookupLocatorDiscovery configured to discover the
 *        set of locators whose elements are the locators of each lookup
 *        service that was started
 *   <li> one DiscoveryListener registered with that LookupLocatorDiscovery
 *   <li> after discovery, the LookupLocatorDiscovery utility is re-configured
 *        to discover a new set of locators; a set that contains none of
 *        the locators with which it was originally configured
 * </ul><p>
 * 
 * If the lookup locator discovery utility functions as specified, then the
 * listener will receive the expected discarded events, having the expected
 * contents.
