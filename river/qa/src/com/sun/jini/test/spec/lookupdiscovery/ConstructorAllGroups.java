/**
 * This class verifies that the <code>LookupDiscovery</code> utility
 * operates in a manner consistent with the specification. In particular,
 * this class verifies that when the parameter input to the constructor
 * is <code>null</code> (ALL_GROUPS), then attempts will be made to discover
 * all lookup services located within the current multicast radius, regardless
 * of group membership.
 *
 * The environment in which this class expects to operate is as follows:
 * <p><ul>
 *   <li> one or more initial lookup services started during setup
 *   <li> an instance of the lookup discovery utility constructed with
 *        a null parameter
 *   <li> one instance of DiscoveryListener registered with the lookup
 *        discovery utility
 * </ul><p>
 * 
 * If the lookup discovery utility functions as specified, then the client's
 * listener will receive the expected discovery events, with the expected
 * contents.
