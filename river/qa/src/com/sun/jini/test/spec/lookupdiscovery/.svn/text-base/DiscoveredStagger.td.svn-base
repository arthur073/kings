# Interval over which lookup services send multicast announcements is set very short to increase
# the probability of receiving multicast announcements from a desired lookup in a noisy environment.

# Number of seconds to wait for discovered/discarded/changed events is set high
# to allow slower OS's in noisy environments a chance to process events
# Since the events arrive over a long (staggered) period of time, the
# default amount of time to wait for events in this test must be overridden
# to guarantee that the appropriate wait period is applied.

# Will discard a lookup if the expected number of multicast announcements
# do not arrive within net.jini.discovery.announce number of seconds.
# Set this property to 2 minutes so that on slower OS's in noisy environments,
# we don't get un-intended discards occurring
