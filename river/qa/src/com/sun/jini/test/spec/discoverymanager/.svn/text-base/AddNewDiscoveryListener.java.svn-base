/**
 * With respect to the <code>addDiscoveryListener</code> method, this class
 * verifies that the <code>LookupDiscoveryManager</code> utility operates in
 * a manner consistent with the specification.
 * <p>
 * In particular, this class verifies that upon adding a new instance of
 * <code>DiscoveryListener</code> to a lookup discovery manager configured
 * to discover a set of lookup services through a MIX of group discovery and
 * locator discovery, the lookup discovery manager will send a discovered
 * event - with the appropriate contents - to that listener for each
 * lookup service that satisfies the discovery criteria.
 *
 * The environment in which this class expects to operate is as follows:
 * <p><ul>
 *    <li> N lookup services having locator L0i, and belonging to groups
 *         {G0i,G1i,G2i}, where i = 0 ... N
 *    <li> one lookup discovery manager configured to discover some of the
 *         lookups by only group discovery, some by only locator discovery,
 *         and some by both group and locator discovery
 *    <li> one instance of DiscoveryListener registered with the lookup
 *         discovery manager
 *    <li> after discovery, a new instance of DiscoveryListener is added to
 *         the lookup discovery manager utility through the invocation of the
 *         addDiscoveryListener method
 * </ul><p>
 * 
 * If the lookup discovery manager functions as specified, then each of the
 * client's listeners will receive the expected number of discovery events,
 * with the expected contents.
