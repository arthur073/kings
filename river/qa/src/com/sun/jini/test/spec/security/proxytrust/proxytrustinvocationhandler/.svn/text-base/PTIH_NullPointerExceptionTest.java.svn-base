/**
 * <pre>
 * Purpose
 *   This test verifies the following:
 *     ProxyTrustInvocationHandler constructor throws NullPointerException if
 *     any argument is null.
 *
 * Action
 *   The test performs the following steps:
 *     1) construct a ProxyTrustInvocationHandler with non-null value for main
 *        proxy and null value for bootstrap proxy
 *     2) assert that NullPointerException will be thrown
 *     3) construct a ProxyTrustInvocationHandler with null value for main proxy
 *        and non-null value for bootstrap proxy
 *     4) assert that NullPointerException will be thrown
 *     5) construct a ProxyTrustInvocationHandler with null value for main proxy
 *        and null value for bootstrap proxy
 *     6) assert that NullPointerException will be thrown
 * </pre>
