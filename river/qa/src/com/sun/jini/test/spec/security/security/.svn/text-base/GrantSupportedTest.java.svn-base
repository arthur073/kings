/**
 * <pre>
 * Purpose
 *   This test verifies the following:
 *     'grantSupported' static method of Security class returns true if the
 *     installed security policy provider supports dynamic permission grants -
 *     i.e., if it implements the DynamicPolicy interface and calling its
 *     'grantSupported' method returns true. Returns false otherwise.
 *
 * Infrastructure
 *   This test requires the following infrastructure:
 *     NonDynamicPolicyProvider - policy provider which does not implement
 *             DynamicPolicy interface
 *     TestDynamicPolicyProvider - policy provider implementing DynamicPolicy
 *             interface whose 'grantSupported' method returns false/true
 *             depending on value set by 'setGrantSupported(boolean)' method.
 *             This provider is used to verify that grantSupported values
 *             aren't cached per-provider
 *
 * Action
 *   The test performs the following steps:
 *     1) set current policy provider to NonDynamicPolicyProvider
 *     2) invoke 'grantSupported' static method of Security class
 *     3) assert that false will be returned
 *     4) set current policy provider to TestDynamicPolicyProvider
 *     5) set value returned by 'grantSupported' method of
 *        TestDynamicPolicyProvider to false
 *     6) invoke 'grantSupported' static method of Security class
 *     7) assert that 'grantSupported' method of TestDynamicPolicyProvider will
 *        be invoked
 *     8) assert that false will be returned
 *     9) set value returned by 'grantSupported' method of
 *        TestDynamicPolicyProvider to true
 *     10) invoke 'grantSupported' static method of Security class
 *     11) assert that 'grantSupported' method of TestDynamicPolicyProvider will
 *         be invoked
 *     12) assert that true will be returned
 * </pre>
