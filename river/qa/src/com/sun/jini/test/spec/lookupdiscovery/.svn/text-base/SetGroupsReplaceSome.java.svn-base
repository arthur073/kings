/**
 * With respect to the <code>setGroups</code> method, this class verifies
 * that the <code>LookupDiscovery</code> utility operates in a manner
 * consistent with the specification. In particular, this class verifies
 * that upon invoking the <code>setGroups</code> method to re-configure
 * the <code>LookupDiscovery</code> utility to discover a new set of
 * member groups which replaces the current set of member groups to discover,
 * and which contains some (but not all) of the member groups with which it was
 * previously configured, that utility will send discarded events referencing
 * the previously discovered lookup services that do not belong to
 * any of the new member groups.
 *
 * The environment in which this class expects to operate is as follows:
 * <p><ul>
 *   <li> one or more lookup services, each belonging to a finite set of
 *        member groups
 *   <li> one instance of LookupDiscovery configured to discover the union
 *        of the member groups to which each lookup belongs 
 *   <li> one DiscoveryListener registered with that LookupDiscovery
 *   <li> after discovery, the LookupDiscovery utility is re-configured
 *        to discover a new set of member groups; a set that contains only
 *        some of the groups with which it was originally configured
 * </ul><p>
 * 
 * If the lookup discovery utility functions as specified, then the listener
 * will receive the expected discarded events, having the expected contents.
