/**
 * With respect to the <code>setGroups</code> method, this class verifies
 * that the <code>LookupDiscovery</code> utility operates in a manner
 * consistent with the specification. In particular, this class verifies
 * that when the parameter input to the <code>setGroups</code> method is
 * an empty array (<code>NO_GROUPS</code>), group discovery is halted until
 * the <code>LookupDiscovery</code> utility is once again configured - through
 * either another call to <code>setGroups</code>, or a call to 
 * <code>addGroups</code> - to discover either a non-empty set of member
 * groups, or <code>ALL_GROUPS</code>.
 *
 * The environment in which this class expects to operate is as follows:
 * <p><ul>
 *    <li> one or more "initial" lookup services, each belonging to a finite
 *         set of member groups, and each started during setup, before the
 *         test begins execution
 *    <li> one or more "additional" lookup services, each belonging to a finite
 *         set of member groups, and each started after the test has begun
 *         execution, and after the initial lookup services started during
 *         setup have been discovered
 *    <li> one instance of the lookup discovery utility initially configured
 *         to discover the member groups of the initial lookup services
 *    <li> one instance of DiscoveryListener registered with the lookup
 *         discovery utility
 *    <li> after the lookup discovery utility is constructed, setGroups is
 *         invoked with NO_GROUPS to halt discovery processing; and is
 *         eventually invoked again to restart discovery processing for
 *         the addtional lookup services
 * </ul><p>
 * 
 * If the lookup discovery utility functions as specified, then the client's
 * listener will receive the expected discovered events, with the expected
 * contents, at the expected times during the test.

     *    <li> starts the multicast discovery process by adding a discovery
     *         listener to the lookup discovery utility
     *    <li> verifies that group discovery is currently operational by

     *    <li> starts an additional set of lookups to discover
     *    <li> verifies that group discovery has been halted by verifying that
     *         the lookup discovery utility sends no discovered events 
     *    <li> invokes setGroups again, inputting all of the member groups
     *         with which the lookup discovery utility was initially configured
     *    <li> verifies that group discovery has been restarted by verifying
     *         that the lookup discovery utility under test sends the expected
     *         discovered events, having the expected contents related to the
