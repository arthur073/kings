/**
 * <pre>
 * Purpose
 *   This test verifies the following:
 *     getPort method of JrmpExporter returns the port used by this exporter,
 *     or zero if an anonymous port is used.
 *
 * Test Cases
 *   This test uses different constructors to construct JrmpExporter.
 *
 * Action
 *   For each test case except constructor with no arguments the test
 *   performs the following steps:
 *     1) construct a JrmpExporter using 0 as the port parameter
 *        (anonymous port)
 *     2) invoke getPort method of constructed JrmpExporter
 *     3) assert that getPort method invocation will return 0
 *     4) construct a JrmpExporter using non-zero port as a parameter
 *     5) invoke getPort method of constructed JrmpExporter
 *     6) assert that getPort method invocation will return the same port number
 *        as specified in constructor parameter
 *  For constructor with no arguments the test performs the following steps:
 *    1) construct a JrmpExporter using no-arg constructor
 *    2) invoke getPort method of constructed JrmpExporter
 *    3) assert that getPort method invocation will return 0
