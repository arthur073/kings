/**
 * This class verifies that the <code>LookupDiscovery</code> utility
 * operates in a manner consistent with the specification. In particular,
 * this class verifies that the lookup discovery utility can successfully
 * employ the multicast discovery protocol on behalf of a client to
 * discover a number of pre-determined lookup services and then, for each
 * discovered lookup service, send to the client's listener, the appropriate
 * discovery event containing the set of member groups with which the
 * discovered lookup service was configured.
 *
 * The environment in which this class expects to operate is as follows:
 * <p><ul>
 *   <li> one or more lookup services, each belonging to a finite set of
 *        member groups
 *   <li> one client with one instance of the lookup discovery utility
 *   <li> the lookup discovery utility is configured to discover some of
 *        the lookup services started by the test through group discovery,
 *        some through locator discovery, and some through either group or
 *        locator discovery
 *   <li> one instance of DiscoveryListener registered with the lookup
 *        discovery manager
 * </ul><p>
 * 
 * If the lookup discovery utility functions as specified, then the client's
 * listener will receive the expected discovery events, with the expected
 * contents.
