/** This class is used to perform a simple verification of the following

 *  addLookupLocators() and removeLookupLocators(). This class first
 *  retrieves the initial set of locators belonging to the Registrar and
 *  verifies that the set contains the expected elements (currently, that
 *  set should be empty). A new set of LookupLocators is then added to
 *  the Registrar and the locators belonging to the Registrar are again
 *  retrieved and verified. This class then removes from the Registrar
 *  a sub-set of the locators that were previously added; and retrieves 
 *  the set of all locators belonging to the Registrar and verifies
 *  that the set contains the expected elements.
