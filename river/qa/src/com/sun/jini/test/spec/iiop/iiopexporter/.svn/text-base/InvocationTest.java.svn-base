/**
 * <pre>
 * Purpose
 *   This test tests basic IiopExporter functionality.
 *
 * Test Cases
 *   This test uses different constructors to construct IiopExporter.
 *   In cases when IiopExporter is constructed by no-arg constructor or with
 *   null orb, stub will be manually connected to the orb.
 *
 * Infrastructure
 *   This test requires the following infrastructure:
 *     TestRemoteObject - object that implements java.rmi.Remote interface.
 *     It provides 1 method:
 *     incr - increments incoming value and returns result
 *
 * Action
 *   For each test case the test performs the following steps:
 *     1) construct a IiopExporter
 *     2) construct a TestRemoteObject
 *     3) invoke export method of constructed IiopExporter with constructed
 *        TestRemoteObject as a parameter
 *     4) assert that no exceptions will be thrown while exporting
 *        TestRemoteObject
 *     5) invoke incr method of exported TestRemoteObject in a cycle
 *     6) assert that no exceptions will be thrown during invocation of incr
 *        method
 *     7) assert that each invocation of incr method will return incoming
 *        parameter value + 1
 *     8) invoke unexport method from constructed IiopExporter
 *     9) assert that no exceptions will be thrown during invocation of
 *        unexport method
 *     10) invoke incr method of exported TestRemoteObject
 *     11) assert that java.rmi.RemoteException or
 *         org.omg.CORBA.OBJECT_NOT_EXIST will be thrown during invocation
 *         of incr method
 * </pre>
