/**
 * This class verifies that the <code>LookupLocatorDiscovery</code> utility
 * operates in a manner consistent with the specification. In particular,
 * this class verifies that "discovery processing begins when an instance
 * of <code>LookupLocatorDiscovery</code> is created, and ends when that
 * instance's <code>terminate</code> method is invoked."
 * <p>
 * The environment in which this class expects to operate is as follows:
 * <p><ul>
 *   <li> one or more initial lookup services started during setup
 *   <li> one or more additional lookup services to be started after
 *        termination of the lookup locator discovery utility
 *   <li> an instance of the lookup locator discovery utility configured to
 *        discover the set of locators whose elements are the locators of
 *        both the initial and the addtional lookup services
 *   <li> one instance of DiscoveryListener registered with the lookup
 *        locator discovery utility
 * </ul><p>
 * 
 * If the lookup locator discovery utility functions as specified, then the
 * client's listener will receive the expected discovered events, with the
 * expected contents prior to termination, and will receive no more discovered
 * events after termination of the lookup locator discovery utility.
