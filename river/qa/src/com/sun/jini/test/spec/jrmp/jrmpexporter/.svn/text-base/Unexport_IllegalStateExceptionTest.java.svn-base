/**
 * <pre>
 * Purpose
 *   This test verifies the following:
 *     JrmpExporter.unexport method will throw IllegalStateException if an
 *     object was not exported via this exporter.
 *
 * Test Cases
 *   This test uses different constructors to construct JrmpExporter.
 *
 * Action
 *   For each test case the test performs the following steps:
 *     1) construct a JrmpExporter
 *     2) invoke unexport method from constructed JrmpExporter with true as
 *        a parameter
 *     3) assert that IllegalStateException will be thrown
 *     4) invoke unexport method from constructed JrmpExporter with false as
 *        a parameter
 *     5) assert that IllegalStateException will be thrown
 * </pre>
