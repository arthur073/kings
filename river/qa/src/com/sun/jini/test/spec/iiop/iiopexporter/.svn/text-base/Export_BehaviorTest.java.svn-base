/**
 * <pre>
 * Purpose
 *  This test verifies the following:
 *    If an ORB was specified during construction of this exporter, then the
 *    returned by export method RMI-IIOP stub will be connected to it.
 *
 * Test Cases
 *   This test uses different constructors to construct IiopExporter.
 *
 * Infrastructure
 *   This test requires the following infrastructure:
 *     TestRemoteObject - object that implements java.rmi.Remote interface.
 *
 * Action
 *   For each test case the test performs the following steps:
 *     1) construct a IiopExporter1, using no-arg constructor
 *     2) construct a TestRemoteObject
 *     3) invoke export method of constructed IiopExporter1 with constructed
 *        TestRemoteObject as a parameter
 *     4) when IiopExporter is constructed using non-null ORB:
 *        assert that returned RMI-IIOP stub will be connected to the same
 *        ORB as specified in constructor's parameter.
 *        Otherwise (when IiopExporter is constructed using null ORB or
 *        by no-arg constructor: assert that returned RMI-IIOP stub will
 *        not be connected to any ORB
 * </pre>
