 * contains at least one <code>null</code> element will result in a
 * <code>NullPointerException</code>.
 *
 * The environment in which this class expects to operate is as follows:
 * <p><ul>
 *    <li> no lookup services
 *    <li> an instance of the lookup discovery utility initially configured to
 *         discover a finite set of groups (not NO_GROUPS and not ALL_GROUPS)
 * </ul><p>
 * 
 * If the lookup discovery utility functions as specified, then invoking
 * the <code>setGroups</code> method with an input array that contains
 * at least at least one <code>null</code> element will result in a
 * <code>NullPointerException</code>.
