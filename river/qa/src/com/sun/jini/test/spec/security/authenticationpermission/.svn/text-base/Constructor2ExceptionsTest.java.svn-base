/**
 * <pre>
 * Purpose
 *   This test verifies the following:
 *     Constructor with 3 parameters of AuthenticationPermission throws
 *     NullPointerException if the local principals set or the actions string
 *     is null. It throws IllegalArgumentException if the local principals set
 *     is empty, or either set contains objects that are not
 *     java.security.Principal instances, or the actions string does not match
 *     the syntax specified in the comments at the beginning of this class.
 *
 * Infrastructure
 *   This test requires the following infrastructure:
 *     NonPrincipal - class which does not extend java.security.Principal
 *
 * Action
 *   The test performs the following steps:
 *     1) construct AuthenticationPermission using 3-args constructor with null
 *        set of local principals and non-null actions list
 *     2) assert that NullPointerException will be thrown
 *     3) construct AuthenticationPermission using 3-args constructor with
 *        non-null set of local principals and null actions list
 *     4) assert that NullPointerException will be thrown
 *     5) construct AuthenticationPermission using 3-args constructor with null
 *        set of local principals and null actions list
 *     6) assert that NullPointerException will be thrown
 *     7) construct AuthenticationPermission using 3-args constructor with empty
 *        set of local principals
 *     8) assert that IllegalArgumentException will be thrown
 *     9) construct AuthenticationPermission using 3-args constructor with
 *        set of local principals containing NonPrincipal class instance
 *     10) assert that IllegalArgumentException will be thrown
 *     11) construct AuthenticationPermission using 3-args constructor with
 *         different wrong actions names:
 *         "", "*", "lisSten", "accept, lisSten", "accept listen"
 *     12) assert that IllegalArgumentException will be thrown
 * </pre>
