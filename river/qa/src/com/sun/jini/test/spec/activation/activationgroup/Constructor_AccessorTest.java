/**
 * <pre>
 * Purpose:
 *   This test verifies the behavior of the ActivationGroup
 *   abstract class during normal constructor call.
 *
 * Infrastructure:
 *   This test requires the following infrastructure:
 *     1) FakeActivationGroup implementation of
 *        the tested ActivationGroup class
 *
 * Actions:
 *   Test performs the following steps:
 *       1) construct an ActivationGroupID object
 *          passing null as a parameter
 *       2) construct an FakeActivationGroup object
 *          passing null as a parameter
 *       3) construct an FakeActivationGroup object
 *          passing ActivationGroupID object as a parameter
 *       4) get the RemoteRef from the constructed object;
 *          assert that it is instance of UnicastServerRef
 *          (exporting the grop as UnicastRemoteObject)
 * </pre>
