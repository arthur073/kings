/**
 * This class verifies that the <code>LookupLocatorDiscovery</code> utility
 * operates in a manner consistent with the specification. In particular,
 * this class verifies that "if <code>null</code> is passed to the constructor,
 * discovery will not be started until the <code<addLocators</code> method
 * is called with a non-<code>null</code>, non-empty set".
 * <p>
 * The environment in which this class expects to operate is as follows:
 * <p><ul>
 *   <li> one or more initial lookup services started during setup
 *   <li> an instance of the lookup locator discovery utility created by
 *        passing null to the constructor
 *   <li> one instance of DiscoveryListener registered with the lookup
 *        locator discovery utility
 * </ul><p>
 * 
 * If the lookup locator discovery utility functions as specified, then the
 * listener will receive no events until the <code>addLocators</code> method
 * is called to re-configure the lookup locator discovery utility to discover
 * the lookup services started during setup.
