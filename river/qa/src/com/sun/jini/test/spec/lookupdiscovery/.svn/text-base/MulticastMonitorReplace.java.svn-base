/**
 * This class verifies that the <code>LookupDiscovery</code> utility
 * monitors the multicast announcements sent from the lookup service
 * in a manner consistent with the specification. In particular, this
 * class verifies that when the lookup discovery utility, through the
 * contents of the multicast announcements it receives, determines that
 * the member groups of a particular lookup service it had previously
 * discovered have changed in such a way that the lookup service is no
 * longer of any interest, the lookup discovery utility discards that
 * lookup service.
 *
 *  The environment in which this class expects to operate is as follows:
 *  <p><ul>
 *   <li> one or more lookup services, each belonging to a finite set of
 *        member groups
 *   <li> one instance of LookupDiscovery configured to discover the union
 *        of the member groups to which each lookup service belongs 
 *   <li> one DiscoveryListener registered with the lookup discovery utility
 *   <li> after discovery, the member groups of each previously discovered
 *        lookup service is changed to a set in which NONE of the elements
 *        is a group the lookup discovery utility is interested in discovering
 *  </ul><p>
 * 
 * If the <code>LookupDiscovery</code> utility functions as specified,
 * then because the previously discovered lookup services no longer belong
 * to any of the groups of interest, the lookup discovery utility will
 * discard each of those lookup services.
