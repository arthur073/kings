/**
 * This class verifies that the <code>LookupLocatorDiscovery</code> utility
 * operates in a manner consistent with the specification. In particular,
 * this class verifies that the lookup locator discovery utility can
 * successfully employ the unicast discovery protocol on behalf of a client
 * to discover both lookup services that already exist when the utility
 * is constructed, and lookup services that are started after the utility is
 * created.
 *
 * The environment in which this class expects to operate is as follows:
 * <p><ul>
 *   <li> one or more "initial" lookup services, each started during setup,
 *        before the test begins execution
 *   <li> one or more "additional" lookup services, each started after the
 *        test has begun execution, and after the initial lookup services
 *        started during setup have been discovered
 *   <li> one instance of the lookup locator discovery utility
 *   <li> the lookup locator discovery utility is configured to discover the
 *        set of locators whose elements are the locators of each lookup
 *        service that is to be started
 *   <li> one instance of DiscoveryListener registered with the lookup
 *        locator discovery utility
 * </ul><p>
 * 
 * If the lookup locator discovery utility functions as specified, then the
 * listener will receive the expected discovery events, with the expected
 * contents.
