 * The environment in which this class expects to operate is as follows:
 * <p><ul>
 *   <li> one or more initial lookup services started during setup
 *   <li> one or more additional lookup services to be started after
 *        setLocators is invoked with the empty set
 *   <li> an instance of the lookup locator discovery utility configured to
 *        discover the set of locators whose elements are the locators of
 *        both the initial and the addtional lookup services
 *   <li> one instance of DiscoveryListener registered with the lookup
 *        locator discovery utility
 * </ul><p>
 * 
 * If the lookup locator discovery utility functions as specified, then
 * after invoking the <code>setLocators</code> method with the empty
 * set, discovery will cease.
