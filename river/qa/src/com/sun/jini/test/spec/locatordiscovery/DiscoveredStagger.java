/**
 * This class verifies that the <code>LookupLocatorDiscovery</code> utility
 * operates in a manner consistent with the specification. In particular,
 * this class verifies that the lookup locator discovery utility can
 * successfully employ the unicast discovery protocol on behalf of a client
 * to discover lookup services that are started at various times before and
 * during the operation of the lookup locator discovery utility.
 *
 * The environment in which this class expects to operate is as follows:
 * <p><ul>
 *    <li> one or more lookup services, each started at various "staggered"
 *         times throughout the test, each having a known unicast port
 *    <li> one instance of the lookup locator discovery utility
 *    <li> the lookup locator discovery utility is configured to discover the
 *         set of locators whose elements are the locators of each lookup
 *         service that is to be started
 *    <li> one instance of DiscoveryListener registered with the lookup
 *         locator discovery utility
 * </ul><p>
 * 
 * If the lookup locator discovery utility functions as specified, then the
 * listener will receive the expected discovery events, with the expected
 * contents.
