/** This class is used to verify that the method getServiceTypes() operates
 *  as expected when an "empty" template is input.
 *
 *  In particular, this test wishes to verify the following statement from
 *  the lookup specification:
 *
 *    "The getServiceTypes method looks at all service items that match the
 *     specified template, and for every service item finds the most specific
 *     type (class or interface) or types the service item is an instance of
 *     that are neither equal to, nor a superclass of, any of the service
 *     types in the template ..."
 *  
 *  The difference between this test class and the other classes that
 *  test getServiceTypes() is in the template that is used for matching
 *  the registered services. This class will input a template containing
 *  "wild cards" in all fields; whereas the other test classes will employ
 *  templates that match on other criteria.
 * 
 *  To perform this test, N instances of each of the test service classes
 *  are created and registered with the lookup service and an empty template
 *  is created. For each of the service classes, getServiceTypes() is 
 *  called with the template as input argument. The array of class types that
 *  is returned is then compared against the expected set of class type
 *  descriptors.
