/**
 * This class verifies that the <code>LookupDiscovery</code> utility
 * operates in a manner consistent with the specification. In particular,
 * this class verifies that when the parameter input to the constructor
 * contains at least 1 element that is a duplicate of another element in
 * the input set, the <code>LookupDiscovery</code> utility operates
 * as if the constructor was invoked with the duplicates removed from the
 * input set.
 *
 * The environment in which this class expects to operate is as follows:
 * <p><ul>
 *   <li> one or more initial lookup services started during setup
 *   <li> an instance of the lookup discovery utility constructed
 *        using a set of groups in which at least 1 element duplicates
 *        at least 1 other element in the set
 *   <li> one instance of DiscoveryListener registered with the lookup
 *        discovery utility
 * </ul><p>
 * 
 * If the lookup discovery utility functions as specified, then the client's
 * listener will receive the expected number of discovery events, with the
 * expected contents.
