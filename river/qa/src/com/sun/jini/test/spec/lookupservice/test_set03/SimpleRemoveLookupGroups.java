/** This class is used to perform a simple verification of the following
 *  methods from the Joindmin interface: getLookupGroups(), addLookupGroups()
 *  and removeLookupGroups(). This class first retrieves the initial set of 
 *  groups that the lookup service should join; then verifies that that 
 *  set contains the expected groups. A new set of groups to join is then
 *  added to the Registrar's set of groups; and all of its groups are
 *  again retrieved and verified against the expected set of groups. This
 *  class then removes each of the groups from the Registrar; as each set
 *  is removed it retrieves the new list from the Registrar and verifies
 *  that it contains the expected set of groups to join.
