/**
 * <pre>
 * Purpose
 *   This test verifies the following:
 *     JrmpExporter.export method will throw IllegalStateException if an object
 *     has already been exported via this exporter.
 *
 * Test Cases
 *   This test uses different constructors to construct JrmpExporter.
 *
 * Infrastructure
 *   This test requires the following infrastructure:
 *     TestRemoteObject - object that implements java.rmi.Remote interface.
 *
 * Action
 *   For each test case the test performs the following steps:
 *     1) construct a JrmpExporter
 *     2) construct TestRemoteObject1
 *     3) invoke export method from constructed JrmpExporter with constructed
 *        TestRemoteObject1 as a parameter
 *     4) invoke export method from constructed JrmpExporter with constructed
 *        TestRemoteObject1 as a parameter again
 *     5) assert that IllegalStateException will be thrown
 *     6) construct TestRemoteObject2
 *     7) invoke export method from constructed JrmpExporter with constructed
 *        TestRemoteObject2 as a parameter.
 *     8) assert that IllegalStateException will be thrown
 *     9) invoke unexport method from constructed JrmpExporter
 *     10) invoke export method from constructed JrmpExporter with constructed
 *         TestRemoteObject2 as a parameter.
 *     11) assert that IllegalStateException will be thrown
 * </pre>
