/**
 * This class verifies that the <code>LookupDiscovery</code> utility
 * operates in a manner consistent with the specification. In particular,
 * this class verifies that the method <code>getRegistrars</code> returns
 * an array of <code>ServiceRegistrar</code> instances in which each element
 * of the array is a proxy to one of the lookup services the lookup discovery
 * utility has discovered.
 *
 * The environment in which this class expects to operate is as follows:
 * <p><ul>
 *    <li> one or more lookup services, each belonging to a finite set of
 *         member groups
 *    <li> one instance of LookupDiscovery configured to discover the union
 *         of the member groups to which each lookup belongs 
 *    <li> one instance of DiscoveryListener registered with that
 *         LookupDiscovery utility
 * </ul><p>
 * 
 * If the lookup discovery utility functions as specified, then the
 * <code>getRegistrars</code> method will return an array containing the
 * same registrars as those that were started (and ultimately discovered
 * by the lookup discovery utility).
