/**
 * This class verifies that the <code>LookupLocatorDiscovery</code> utility
 * operates in a manner consistent with the specification. In particular, this
 * class verifies that "the method <code>getUndiscoveredLocators</code> returns
 * a new array upon each invocation."
 *
 * The environment in which this class expects to operate is as follows:
 * <p><ul>
 *    <li> one or more initial lookup services with explicitly configured
 *         port numbers that are actually started during setup
 *    <li> one or more addtional lookup services with explicitly configured
 *         port numbers that are never actually started during the test
 *    <li> one client with one instance of the lookup locator discovery utility
 *    <li> the lookup locator discovery utility is configured to discover the
 *         set of locators whose elements are the locators of the initial
 *         lookup services and the addtional lookup services
 *    <li> one instance of DiscoveryListener registered with the lookup
 *         locator discovery utility
 * </ul><p>
 * 
 * If the lookup locator discovery utility functions as specified, then on
 * each separate invocation of the <code>getUndiscoveredLocators</code> method,
 * a new array containing the desired, but not-yet-discovered
 * <code>LookupLocator</code> instances will be returned.
 *
