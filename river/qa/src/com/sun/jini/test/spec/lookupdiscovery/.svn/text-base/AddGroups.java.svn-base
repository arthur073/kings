/**
 * With respect to the <code>addGroups</code> method, this class verifies
 * that the <code>LookupDiscovery</code> utility operates in a manner
 * consistent with the specification. In particular, this class verifies
 * that upon invoking the <code>addGroups</code> method to re-configure
 * the <code>LookupDiscovery</code> utility to discover a set of groups
 * which includes the original set of groups to discover as well as an
 * additional set of groups, that utility will send discovered events
 * referencing any previously un-discovered lookup services whose member
 * groups belong to one or more of the additional set of groups to discover.
 *
 * The environment in which this class expects to operate is as follows:
 * <p><ul>
 *    <li> one or more "initial" lookup services, each belonging to a finite
 *         set of member groups, and each started during setup, before the
 *         test begins execution
 *    <li> one or more "additional" lookup services, each belonging to a finite
 *         set of member groups that does not include any of the member groups
 *         of the initial set of lookup services, and each started after the
 *         test has begun execution
 *    <li> one instance of the lookup discovery utility
 *    <li> the lookup discovery utility is initially configured to discover
 *         the set of groups whose elements are the member groups of the
 *         initial lookup services
 *    <li> one instance of DiscoveryListener registered with the lookup
 *         discovery utility
 * </ul><p>
 * 
 * If the lookup discovery utility functions as specified, then after
 * invoking the <code>addGroups</code> method, the listener will receive the
 * expected discovery events, with the expected contents.
