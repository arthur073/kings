/**
 * This class verifies that the <code>LookupLocatorDiscovery</code> utility

 * particular, this class verifies that when the parameter input to the
 * constructor contains at least 1 <code>null</code> element, a
 * <code>NullPointerException</code> is thrown.
 *
 * The environment in which this class expects to operate is as follows:
 * <p><ul>
 *   <li> no lookup services
 *   <li> an instance of the lookup locator discovery utility constructed
 *        using a set of locators in which at least 1 element is null
 * </ul><p>
 * 
 * If the lookup locator discovery utility functions as specified, then 
 * upon attempting to construct an instance of the lookup locator discovery
 * utility using a set of locators containing at least one <code>null</code>
 * element, a <code>NullPointerException</code> will occur.
