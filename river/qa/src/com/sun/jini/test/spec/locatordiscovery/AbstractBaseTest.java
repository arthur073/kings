/**
 * This class is an abstract class that acts as the base class from which
 * most, if not all, tests of the <code>LookupLocatorDiscovery</code> utility
 * class should extend.
 * <p>
 * This abstract class contains at least one static inner class that can be
 * used as a listener to participate in the process of discovering lookup
 * services on behalf of the tests that are decendants of this abstract class.
 * <p>
 * This class provides an implementation of the <code>setup</code> method
 * which performs standard functions related to the initialization of the
 * system state necessary to execute the test.
 * <p>
 * Any test class that extends this class is required to implement the 
 * <code>run</code> method which defines the actual functions that must
 * be executed in order to verify the assertions addressed by that test.
 * <p>
 * Note that for tests that require lookup services to be started, if the
 * test configuration indicates that random ports are to be used when 
 * starting those lookup services, then the test must be implemented so
 * that those lookup services are started before discovery event processing
 * commences. This is so that the actual port numbers can be retrieved
 * and inserted into the expected event information. Thus, any test that
 * starts the necessary lookup services before discovery event processing
 * begins has the option of using random ports or explicit ports for the
 * lookup services that it starts. On the other hand, any test requiring
 * that its lookup services be started while discovery event processing is
 * in progress must be configured for explicit, pre-assigned, port numbers.
