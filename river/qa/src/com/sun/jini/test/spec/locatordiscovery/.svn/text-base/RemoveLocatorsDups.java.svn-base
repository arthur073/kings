/**
 * With respect to the <code>removeLocators</code> method, this class verifies
 * that the <code>LookupLocatorDiscovery</code> utility operates in a manner
 * consistent with the specification. In particular, this class verifies
 * that when the parameter input to the <code>removeLocators</code> method
 * contains at least one element that is a duplicate of another element in
 * the input set, the <code>LookupLocatorDiscovery</code> utility operates
 * as if <code>removeLocators</code> was invoked with the duplicates removed
 * from the input set.
 *
 * The environment in which this class expects to operate is as follows:
 * <p><ul>
 *   <li> one or more lookup services
 *   <li> one instance of LookupLocatorDiscovery configured to discover the
 *        set of locators whose elements are the locators of each lookup
 *        service that was started
 *   <li> one DiscoveryListener registered with that LookupLocatorDiscovery
 *   <li> after discovery, removeLocators is invoked - with a set of locators
 *        containing duplicates - to remove some of the locators with which
 *        the lookup locator discovery utility was originally configured to
 *        discover
 * </ul><p>
