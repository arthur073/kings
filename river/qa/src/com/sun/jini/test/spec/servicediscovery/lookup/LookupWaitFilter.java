     *     with the lookup services started during setup, the blocking
     *     mechanism of the <code>lookup</code> method blocks for the full
     *     amount of time requested
     *  2. With each of the lookup services started in setup, registers 3
     *     services each with 1 associated attribute 
     *  3. Again invokes the desired version of the <code>lookup</code>
     *     method - applying the filter - and verifies that the service
     *     returned is the service expected, and the <code>lookup</code>
     *     method blocks until the registration of the desired services 
     *     have completed successfully
     *  4. With each of the lookup services started in setup, registers 4
     *     more services each with 1 associated attribute 
     *  5. Again invokes the desired version of the <code>lookup</code>
     *     method - applying the filter - and verifies that because the filter
     *     rejects the services that would normally be discovered if the
     *     filter were not applied, the call to the <code>lookup</code>
     *     method blocks for the full amount of time requested
