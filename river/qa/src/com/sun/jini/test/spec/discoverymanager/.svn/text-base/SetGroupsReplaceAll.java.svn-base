/**
 * With respect to the <code>setGroups</code> method, this class verifies
 * that the <code>LookupDiscoveryManager</code> utility operates in a manner
 * consistent with the specification.
 * <p>
 * In particular, this class verifies that when the lookup discovery manager
 * is configured to discover a set of lookup services through group and/or
 * locator discovery, and the <code>setGroups</code> method is invoked to 
 * reconfigure the lookup discovery manager to discover NONE of the original
 * set of groups to discover, the lookup discovery manager will send to the
 * client's listener, the appropriate events with the appropriate contents.
 *
 * The environment in which this class expects to operate is as follows:
 * <p><ul>
 *    <li> N lookup services having locator L0i, and belonging to groups
 *         {G0i,G1i,G2i}, where i = 0 ... N
 *    <li> one lookup discovery manager configured to discover some of the
 *         lookups by only group discovery, some by only locator discovery,
 *         and some by both group and locator discovery
 *    <li> one instance of DiscoveryListener registered with the lookup
 *         discovery manager
 *    <li> after discovery, the member groups of ALL of the lookups are
 *         replaced with new groups in the lookup discovery manager
 * </ul><p>
 * 
 * If the lookup discovery manager functions as specified, then the client's
 * listener will receive the expected number of discarded events, with the
 * expected contents.
