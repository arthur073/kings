/**
 * <pre>
 * Purpose
 *   This test verifies the following:
 *     IiopExporter.export method will throw NullPointerException if remote
 *     object to export is null.
 *
 * Test Cases
 *   This test uses different constructors to construct IiopExporter.
 *
 * Action
 *   For each test case the test performs the following steps:
 *     1) construct a IiopExporter
 *     2) invoke export method from constructed IiopExporter with null remote
 *        object to export
 *     3) assert that NullPointerException will be thrown
 * </pre>
