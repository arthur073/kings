/**
 * <pre>
 * Purpose
 *   This test verifies the following:
 *     'equals' method of AccessPermission returns true if the specified object
 *     is an instance of the same class as this permission and has the same
 *     target name as this permission; returns false otherwise.
 *
 * Infrastructure
 *   This test requires the following infrastructure:
 *     TestPermission - permission which does not extend AccessPermission
 *     TestAccessPermission - permission extending AccessPermission
 *
 * Action
 *   The test performs the following steps:
 *     1) construct AccessPermission0 with "abc" target name
 *     2) call 'equals' method of constructed AccessPermission0 with
 *        TestPermission as a parameter
 *     3) assert that false will be returned
 *     4) construct TestAccessPermission with "abc" target name
 *     5) call 'equals' method of constructed AccessPermission0 with
 *        TestAccessPermission as a parameter
 *     6) assert that false will be returned
 *     7) construct wrong AccessPermission-s with the following target names:
 *        "ab", "bc", "*abc", "abc*", "a.abc", "*"
 *     8) call 'equals' method of constructed AccessPermission0 with
 *        constructed wrong AccessPermission-s as parameters
 *     9) assert that false will be returned
 *     10) construct AccessPermission1 with "abc" target name
 *     11) call 'equals' method of constructed AccessPermission0 with
 *         AccessPermission1 as a parameter
 *     12) assert that true will be returned
 *     13) call 'equals' method of constructed AccessPermission0 with
 *         the same AccessPermission0 as a parameter
 *     14) assert that true will be returned
 *
 *     15) construct AccessPermission2 with "*abc" target name
 *     16) construct wrong AccessPermission-s with the following target names:
 *         "abc", "aabc", "abc*", "*abcd", "a.*abc", "*"
 *     17) call 'equals' method of constructed AccessPermission2 with
 *         constructed wrong AccessPermission-s as parameters
 *     18) assert that false will be returned
 *     19) construct AccessPermission3 with "*abc" target name
 *     20) call 'equals' method of constructed AccessPermission2 with
 *         AccessPermission3 as a parameter
 *     21) assert that true will be returned
 *
 *     22) construct AccessPermission4 with "abc*" target name
 *     23) construct wrong AccessPermission-s with the following target names:
 *         "abc", "abcd", "*abc", "abcd*", "a.abc*", "*"
 *     24) call 'equals' method of constructed AccessPermission4 with
 *         constructed wrong AccessPermission-s as parameters
 *     25) assert that false will be returned
 *     26) construct AccessPermission5 with "abc*" target name
 *     27) call 'equals' method of constructed AccessPermission4 with
 *         AccessPermission5 as a parameter
 *     28) assert that true will be returned
 *
 *     29) construct AccessPermission6 with "a.b.cde" target name
 *     30) construct wrong AccessPermission-s with the following target names:
 *         "a.cde", "b.cde", "a.b.c.cde", "a.b.cd", "a.b.cdef", "a.b.cde*",
 *         "a.b.*cde", "a.b.*", "*"
 *     31) call 'equals' method of constructed AccessPermission6 with
 *         constructed wrong AccessPermission-s as parameters
 *     32) assert that false will be returned
 *     33) construct AccessPermission7 with "a.b.cde" target name
 *     34) call 'equals' method of constructed AccessPermission6 with
 *         AccessPermission7 as a parameter
 *     35) assert that true will be returned
