/**
 * This class verifies that the <code>LookupDiscovery</code> utility
 * operates in a manner consistent with the specification. In particular,
 * this class verifies that discovery processing begins when an instance
 * of <code>LookupDiscovery</code> is created, and ends when that instance's
 * <code>terminate</code> method is invoked.
 * <p>
 * The environment in which this class expects to operate is as follows:
 * <p><ul>
 *    <li> one or more initial lookup services, each belonging to a finite
 *         set of member groups, started during setup
 *    <li> one or more additional lookup services, each belonging to a finite
 *         set of member groups, to be started after termination of the lookup
 *         discovery utility
 *    <li> an instance of the lookup discovery utility configured to discover
 *         the set of member groups whose elements are the member groups
 *         associated with both the initial and the addtional lookup services
 *    <li> one instance of DiscoveryListener registered with the lookup
 *         discovery utility
 * </ul><p>
 * 
 * If the lookup discovery utility functions as specified, then the client's
 * listener will receive the expected discovered events, with the expected
 * contents prior to termination, and will receive no more discovered events
 * after termination of the lookup discovery utility.
