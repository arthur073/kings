 * This class verifies that the <code>LookupLocatorDiscovery</code>

 * In particular, this class verifies that when the parameter input to
 * the <code>removeLocators</code> method contains at least one
 * <code>null</code> element, a <code>NullPointerException</code> is thrown.
 *
 * The environment in which this class expects to operate is as follows:
 * <p><ul>
 *   <li> zero lookup services
 *   <li> an instance of the lookup locator discovery utility that is
 *        constructed using an array of locators consistent with the
 *        the test's configuration
 * </ul><p>
 * 
 * If the lookup locator discovery utility functions as specified,
 * then when the <code>removeLocators</code> method is invoked with a
 * set of locators in which at least one element is <code>null</code>,
 * a <code>NullPointerException</code> will occur.
