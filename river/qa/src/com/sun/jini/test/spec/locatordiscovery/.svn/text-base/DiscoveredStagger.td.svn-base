# Number of seconds to wait for discovered/discarded/changed events is set high
# to allow slower OS's in noisy environments a chance to process events
# Since the events arrive over a long (staggered) period of time, the
# default amount of time to wait for events in this test must be overridden
# to guarantee that the appropriate wait period is applied.
