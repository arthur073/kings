/**
 * With respect to the <code>discard</code> method, this class verifies that
 * the <code>LookupLocatorDiscovery</code> utility operates in a manner
 * consistent with the specification. In particular, this class verifies
 * that upon invoking <code>discard</code> with an instance of 
 * <code>ServiceRegistrar</code> that does not exist in the utility's
 * managed set of lookup services, no action is taken by <code>discard</code>.
 *
 * The environment in which this class expects to operate is as follows:
 * <p><ul>
 *   <li> one or more lookup services
 *   <li> one instance of LookupLocatorDiscovery configured to discover the
 *        set of locators whose elements are the locators of each lookup
 *        service that was started
 *   <li> one DiscoveryListener registered with that LookupLocatorDiscovery
 *   <li> after discovery, each of the lookup service(s) that were started
 *        are destroyed and then discarded so that it can be verified that
 *        the discard mechanism is operating correctly
 *   <li> the discard method on the LookupLocatorDiscovery instance is then
 *        invoked with a ServiceRegistrar instance that is not an element of
 *        the lookup locator discovery utility's managed set of lookup services
 * </ul><p>
 * 
 * If the <code>LookupLocatorDiscovery</code> utility functions as specified,
 * then a <code>DiscoveryEvent</code> instance indicating a discovered event
 * (accurately reflecting the expected contents) will be sent to the initial
 * listener for each lookup service that was started. Upon the invocation
 * of the <code>discard</code> method with each discovered lookup service,
 * the expected discarded events are sent. And upon the invocation of the
 * <code>discard</code> method with a <code>ServiceRegistrar</code> that 
 * does not exist in the utility's managed set of lookup services, no further
 * events are sent or actions are taken.
