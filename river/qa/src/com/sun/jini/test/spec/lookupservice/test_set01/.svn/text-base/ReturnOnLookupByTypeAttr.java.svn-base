/** This class is used to verify that when a lookup is performed
 *  using a template containing both the Service Type and an attribute, the
 *  Registrar will return a service of that type having that attribute.
 *  Furthermore, this class will verify that the service that is returned
 *  is RANDOMLY SELECTED by the Registrar from the set of services of that
 *  type and having that attribute.
 *
 *  An argument is passed into the test harness indicating how the Registrar
 *  selects a service to return: random, round-robin, always-the-same, etc.
 *  This argument is necessary because the Registrar can use different
 *  selection criteria depending on the contents of the template used
 *  to "filter" the services in the Registrar. For example, if the
 *  the template contains only a service type or both a service type and
 *  attribute information, the services that match the template will be
 *  selectected randomly; whereas if the template contains only attribute
 *  information, the Registrar will always return the same matching service
 *  no matter how many times lookup is called (currently, the service that
 *  is returned is the last service to be registered that has that attribute).
 *
 *  Depending on the value of the input argument, the appropriate test will
 *  be employed to verify that the expected service is returned by the
 *  Registrar. Because the selection process may change in the future, the
 *  input argument allows the test employed to be changed by simply
 *  changing the value of the input argument.
