  <dt> <b>"Pull" Functionality</b>
  <dd> The Jini(TM) Event Mailbox Service
       <a href="../specs/html/mailbox-spec.html">Specification</a>
       was augmented with additional classes and
       interfaces that provide synchronous access to
       events (see sections EM.5-EM.7). Mercury was also
       updated to implement this new functionality. <BR>
       The following work still needs to be done:
       <UL>
       <LI>Implement the timeout functionality for
           <code>RemoteEventIterator.next</code>
       <LI>Make the batching implementation configurable. For example,
           configuring the number of events that get returned to the
           event mailbox client in a single call. Currently all the available
           events are sent.
