Apache River v2.2.0 Release Notes</h1>

<H3>Description</H3>
<code>ClassDep</code> is used to analyze a set of classes and determine on
what other classes they directly or indirectly depend.
<H3>Changes since the v2.2.0 release</H3>

<H3>Changes since the v2.1.1 release</H3>
<dl>
    The new implementation no longer depends upon the Java SDK <code>tools.jar</code>
    library, <a href ="http://asm.ow2.org/">ASM</a> is now used to provide 
    equivalent and extended functionality, including detecting dependencies
    from Annotations and Generics.  Note that if a static class (nested class)
    is included in the dependency graph, references from that static class to
    its immediate lexically enclosing class are included in the dependency
    search now by default.

com.sun.jini.tool.ClassDep should be smarter with outer classes

com.sun.jini.tool.ClassDep empty inside collection doesn't work

ClassDep generates duplicate output lines
</li>

</li>


<H3>Changes since the v2.0.1 release</H3>
<dl>
<dt><b>Executable JAR file</b>
<dd>There is a new executable JAR file, <code>classdep.jar</code>,
that can be used to run <code>ClassDep</code>. The advantage of using
this JAR file is that it automatically loads <code>tools.jar</code>
from your Java(TM) 2 SDK installation, if required.
