<H3>Description</H3>

<p>The <a href="../api/net/jini/activation/package-summary.html">
<code>net.jini.activation</code></a> package provides extensions to the
Java(TM) Remote Method Invocation (Java RMI) activation framework.

<p><a href="../api/net/jini/activation/ActivatableInvocationHandler.html">
<code>ActivatableInvocationHandler</code></a> by default no longer attempts
to propagate dynamic permission grants from the dynamic proxy to the
underlying activation identifier. If this functionality is required, it can
be enabled by setting the
<code>com.sun.jini.activation.enableActivateGrant</code> system property to
<code>true</code>. If the
<a href="../api/net/jini/activation/package-summary.html">
<code>phoenix</code></a> activator has been configured
to allow anonymous client activation requests, and the invocation
constraints on the underlying activation identifier have been configured
to allow anonymous activation calls, it is not necessary to enable this.
That should be the preferred configuration. However, if the activator has
been configured to use Kerberos authentication, then anonymous calls are
not supported, and you will either have to enable the activate grant in
clients and dynamically grant sufficient
<a href="../api/net/jini/security/AuthenticationPermission.html">
<code>AuthenticationPermission</code></a> and
<a href="../api/net/jini/security/GrantPermission.html">
<code>GrantPermission</code></a> to the proxy to permit activation calls
to succeed, or else statically grant sufficient
<code>AuthenticationPermission</code> to downloaded code in clients
to permit activation calls to succeed.
