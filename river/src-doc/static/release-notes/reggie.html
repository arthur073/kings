<h1>Reggie<br>
v2.2.0 Release Notes</h1>
</center>
<hr>
<ul>
<h3>Description</h3>
"Reggie" is the name of the contributed Jini lookup service implementation
from Sun Microsystems. The specification for the River lookup service is 
available in <a href="../specs/html/lookup-spec.html">HTML</a>.
<p/>
The specification for Reggie is defined not only by the <i>Jini Lookup Service
Specification</i>, but also by the API documentation (generated by the 
Javadoc(TM) tool) for <a href="../api/net/jini/admin/Administrable.html">
<code>Administrable</code></a>.

<h3>Changes since the v2.2.0 release</h3>
<li>[<a href='https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/RIVER-374'>RIVER-374</a>] -         Review how LookupLocator is used to provide host and port details for LookupLocatorDiscovery
</li>
<li>[<a href='https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/RIVER-11'>RIVER-11</a>] -         LookupLocatorDiscovery ignores new LookupLocator instances for which only constraints differ
</li>
<h3>Changes since the v2.1.1 release</h3>
<li>[<a href='https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/RIVER-225'>RIVER-225</a>] -         
NullPointerException in Reggie during destroy
</li>
<li>[<a href='https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/RIVER-246'>RIVER-246</a>] -         
Consider adding shutdown hook so Reggie sends final multicast packet if its VM 
is terminated

    <dt><b>Handling of Evolved Types</b></dt>
    <dd>
        Consider the case where service <code>S</code> has been deployed in a
        network, and <code>S</code> needs to be modified to implement
        a new interface.  Let's call the modified service <code>S'</code>.
        In previous versions of Reggie, a client would not find a proxy to
        <code>S'</code> when doing a lookup by the new interface unless
        the <code>S'</code> proxy class was renamed.  This version of Reggie
        allows a client to find a proxy to <code>S'</code> when doing a
        lookup by the new interface, even if the name of the proxy class has
        not been changed and there are instances of <code>S</code> already
        registered.<p/>
    </dd>
    <dt><b>Reuse of Multicast Announcements</b></dt>
    <dd>
        Reggie now reuses multicast announcements when there are no changes
        in host, port, or group information in order to minimize the expense of
        signing announcement packets in deployments that have been configured
        to use secure discovery.<p/>
    </dd>
    <dt><b>Delayed Verification of Multicast Requests</b></dt>
    <dd>
        Reggie also delays verifying signatures on multicast requests until
        it can determine that it must reply to the request.  This minimizes
        the expense of verifying signatures in deployments configured with
        secure discovery.<p/>
    </dd>
    <dt><b>Socket Connection Timeout when Replying to a Multicast
        Request</b></dt>
    <dd>
        This version of Reggie allows a deployer to specify a timeout to be
        applied when establishing a connection to the multicast response
        server of a client attempting to discover Reggie.  The timeout can
        be specified by adding a
        <a href="../api/net/jini/core/constraint/ConnectionRelativeTime.html">
        <code>ConnectionRelativeTime</code></a> constraint to Reggie's
        <code>discoveryConstraints</code>.  For information on additional
        constraints supported by Reggie, refer to
        <a href="../api/com/sun/jini/reggie/package-summary.html">
        <code>Reggie's manual pages</code></a>
        <p/>
    </dd>
    <dt><b>Modifications to Reggie's Proxies</b></dt>
    <dd>
        Reggie's
        <a href="../api/net/jini/core/lookup/ServiceRegistrar.html">
        <code>ServiceRegistrar</code></a>,
        <a href="../api/net/jini/core/lookup/ServiceRegistration.html">
        <code>ServiceRegistration</code></a>,
        <a href="../api/net/jini/core/lease/Lease.html">
        <code>Lease</code></a>, and admin proxies now override
        <code>java.lang.Object.toString()</code> to facilitate debugging by
        providing additional information, like Reggie's
        <a href="../api/net/jini/core/lookup/ServiceID.html">
        <code>ServiceID</code></a> and underlying Java (TM) Remote Method
        Invocation (Java RMI) stub.<p/>
        The communication protocol used between Reggie and its main proxy
        has been modified to enable handling of evolved types.  This new
        protocol is not compatible with that of earlier releases.<p/>
    </dd>
    <dt><b>Log File Format</b></dt>
    <dd>
        The log file format used by the persistent version of Reggie in this
        release is not compatible with that of earlier releases.<p/>
    </dd>
    <dt><b>Bug Fixes</b></dt>
    <dd>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <i>4939735 - Reggie doesn't refresh self-registration on
                restart</i><br/>
                The persistent version of reggie no longer stores its
                self-registration; rather, the self-registration is recreated
                each time reggie is restarted to allow for configuration or
                export changes to be reflected in the proxy reggie registers
                with itself.
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>5002218 - Reggie should properly handle remote calls that
                arrive before initialization is complete</i><br/>
                Calls that arrive while reggie is in the process
                of initializing will now block until reggie has completed its
                initialization.  Calls that arrive after reggie has commenced
                its shutdown process will now result in a
                <code>java.rmi.NoSuchObjectException</code>.
            </li>
        </ul>
