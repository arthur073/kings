/**
 * PermissionGrant implementations are expected to be immutable, non blocking,
 * thread safe and have a good hashCode implementation to perform well in
 * Collections.
 * 
 * Developers may use decorators to alter the behaviour of existing implementations.
 * Decorators should use a single transient volatile field to store the result of
 * an event notification, which must be immutable, state
 * may not be updated in the policy until {@link Policy#refresh()} is called.
 * 
 * PermissionGrant does not implement Serializable for security reasons, 
 * however classes extending PermissionGrant may implement Serializable,
 * but are forced to use the Serializable Builder Pattern.  Child classes
 * cannot contain circular references to themselves if they implement
 * Serializable. {@link http://wiki.apache.org/river/Serialization}
 * 
 * You shouldn't pass around PermissionGrant's to just anyone; they can
 * provide an attacker with information about granted Permissions.
 * 
 * Caveat Implementor: PermissionGrant's cannot perform privileged actions, 
 * whilst being used by the policy to make policy decisions, any privileged 
 * actions should performed prior to creating a PermissionGrant.  
 * Only PermissionGrant's belonging to the same ProtectionDomain as the
 * active Policy can perform PrivilegedAction's, since the Policy caches it's 
 * own domain Permissions during initialisation, it doesn't consult
 * PermissionGrant's thereafter.
 * 
 * 
 * @since 2.2.1

     * I had originally wanted this class to be an interface, however it became
     * obvious during development that securing an interface would be more
     * challenging despite the added flexibility it would provide.
     * 
     * The interface solution required the policy to have an additional cache
     * where the set of permissions were stored in a map, in case the 
     * implementor tried to mutate those permissions.
     * 
     * To avoid escallation of privileges, some fields and methods are final.
     * 
     * Overriding classes are restricted in how they can implement Serializable, such
     * that all guards are checked after deserialization is complete so
     * all ProtectionDomains are on the call stack.
     * 
     * Child classes are prevented from modifying the contained immutable Permissions.
