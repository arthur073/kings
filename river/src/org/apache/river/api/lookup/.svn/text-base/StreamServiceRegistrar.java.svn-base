/**
 * <p>
 * Defines an extension interface to the lookup service, for use on large or 
 * global networks such as the internet or low bandwidth networks.  
 * The interface is not a remote interface; each implementation of the 
 * lookup service exports proxy objects that implement the 
 * StreamServiceRegistrar interface local to the client, using an
 * implementation-specific protocol to communicate with the actual remote 
 * server.  All of the proxy methods obey normal RMI remote interface 
 * semantics except where explicitly noted.  Two proxy objects are equal if 
 * they are proxies for the same lookup service.  Every method invocation 
 * (on both StreamServiceRegistrar and ServiceRegistration) is atomic with 
 * respect to other invocations.
 * <p></p>
 * StreamServiceRegistrar is intended to perform the same function
 * as ServiceRegistrar, but with the ability to return results as a 
 * stream, so memory consumption is minimised at the client and network
 * communication is minimised between the client and lookup service server. 
 * <p>
