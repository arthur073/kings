/**
 * <p>
 * ServiceItemClasspathSub is intended for client side filtering of lookup
 * service results prior to clients using a service, the lookup service
 * that implements this class, implements #getServiceItem(), so clients
 * can obtain a complete ServiceItem when required after filtering.
 * </p><p>
 * ServiceItemClasspathSub extends ServiceItem and can be used anywhere a 
 * ServiceItem is required for querying or inspecting Entry fields that are
 * resolvable from the local classpath.  If dynamically downloaded code is 
 * required, Remote or Serializable object references are not resolved, 
 * instead, such fields are set to null to avoid codebase download.
 * </p><p>
 * ServiceItemClasspathSub inherits all fields from ServiceItem.
 * </p><p>
 * Some fields in ServiceItemClasspathSub may be null or fields in Entry's may 
 * be null or even the service reference may be null, these fields would be 
 * non-null in a ServiceItem that resolves classes from dynamically downloaded 
 * code or a remote codebase.
 * </p><p>
 * The serviceID field shall be non-null always.
 * </p><p>
 * ServiceItem's toString() method will return a different result for
 * ServiceItemClasspathSub instances.
 * </p><p>
 * When required, a new ServiceItem that is unmarshalled 
 * using remote codebases and dynamically downloaded code can be obtained 
 * by calling #getServiceItem().
