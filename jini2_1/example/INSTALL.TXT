INSTALLATION --

  1. Copy the zip file jini-start-examples.zip to
     a directory of your choosing; and unzip that
     file from that location.

     Although the particular directory you choose
     doesn't matter, for ease of use, it is recommended
     that the zip file be placed in the top-level
     directory of the starter kit. For example, suppose
     the location of the jini2_1 directory is one of
     the following,

             unix                  windows
     -----------------------------------------------
          ~/jini2_1               c:\jini2_1

     Then copy jini-start-examples.zip to either
     ~/jini2_1 or c:\jini2_1, depending on your
     OS, and unzip from that location.

  2. After unzipping jini-start-examples.zip, edit
     one of the following files, depending on your
     OS:

             unix                  windows
     -----------------------------------------------
     example/scripts/urun  example\scripts\wrun.bat

     Change to the appropriate value, each of the
     following constants (which are located at the
     top of the file):

             unix                  windows
     -----------------------------------------------
           JDK_HOME               JDK_HOME
           JINI_HOME              JINI_HOME
                                  HOSTNAME
           EXAMPLE_HOME           EXAMPLE_HOME

     Note that, on unix, it is not necessary to set the
     value of the HOSTNAME constant. On Windows, it may
     or may not be necessary to set that constant. If 
     your hostname is equivalent to the value of the
     COMPUTERNAME environment variable, then it is not
     necessary to change the value of HOSTNAME constant.
     Finally, it will be necessary to set the value of
     EXAMPLE_HOME (on either unix or windows) only if
     you expanded jini-start-examples.zip from a
     location different than that recommended in step 1.
     above.
